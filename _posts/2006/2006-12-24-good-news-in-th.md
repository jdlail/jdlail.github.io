The latest issue of Barron's -- out just in time for Christmas -- has an article about my employer, E.W. Scripps, that is getting a lot of buzz on investing Web forums. The article is behind Barron's pay subscription wall, but here's a Reuters [story on the story](https://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=businessNews&storyid=2006-12-24T174858Z_01_N24279033_RTRUKOC_0_US-EWSCRIPPS-BARRONS.xml&src=rss). A couple of big name analysts are forecasting a $60 to $62 share price over the next year. Friday's close was $49.23. Fav graph:

> Scripps looks like a million bucks, and it's just warming up," Larry Haverty, media specialist and co-portfolio manager at Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust fund, told Barron's.

So not all the news about newspaper stocks is bad. Course, Scripps is often considered a newspaper stock, but newspapers -- still a big chunk of the company -- are not its largest business segment these days. The biggest piece of the pie is Scripps Networks (HGTV, the Food Network, GAC and others). Tags: [SSP](https://technorati.com/tag/ssp) | [E.W. Scripps](https://technorati.com/tag/E.W. Scripps)
