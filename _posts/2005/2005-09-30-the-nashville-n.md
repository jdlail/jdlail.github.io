I found "[the nashville nobody knows](https://candacecorrigan.com/v-web/b2/index.php)" searching through the podcasts on iTunes. Looks like a nice podcast program. Anybody who interviews Sam Bush, Tim O'Brien and Darrell Scott has Producer [Candace Corrigan](https://www.candacecorrigan.com/about.html), a singer/songwriter herself, at least has good taste in picking show subjects. Sounds interesting.
