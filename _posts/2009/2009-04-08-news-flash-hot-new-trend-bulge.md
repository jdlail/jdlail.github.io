Twitter's growth is exploding, but it's not coming those usual trend setters, the 18-24 group. [Sarah Radwanick writes](https://www.comscore.com/blog/2009/04/twitter_traffic_explodes.html):  
  
> It is the 25-54 year old crowd that is actually driving this trend. More specifically, 45-54 year olds are 36 percent more likely than average to visit Twitter, making them the highest indexing age group, followed by 25-34 year olds, who are 30 percent more likely.
