[![Knoxville overground open house](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3341/3291814888_c43ae5806e.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/3291814888/ "Knoxville Overground open house by jacklail on Flickr")  
I went by the [Knoxville Overground](https://www.knoxvilleoverground.com/about-ko/) opening party last night. They were doing tours of the upstairs space in the Sequoyah Hills offices. This is a shot in the front room where I thought I could hang around for awhile. It'll be interesting to see how this develops; it's an ambitious effort to do in Knoxville. I have a couple [more photos](https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=KO&m=tags&ss=0&ct=0&w=96661011%40N00).
