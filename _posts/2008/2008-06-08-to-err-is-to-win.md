Funniest thing I've read all weekend. I guess that's because I [helped](/2008/06/the-mystery-of-the-couch-in-kn.html) and [helped](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/jun/07/blogging-not-couch-yet/). Some more [links](https://blognetwork.knoxnews.com/search.php?rss_query=couch&image.x=7&image.y=6).

> IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ACCURATE, but it was smart! Allison Glock's _New York Times_ piece on Knoxville contained this introduction: "KNOXVILLE is often called 'the couch' by the people who live there. It's a place too unassuming to shout about but too comfortable to leave." That's a nice intro, but nobody in Knoxville can [remember](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2008/06/more_on_the_nyt.shtml) ever hearing it called "the couch." But thanks to that bit, Glock's story is the [most-blogged](https://travel.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/travel/08Hours.html?8dpc#) item in the _Times_ at the moment. My advice to travel writers -- always open your point with a minor error that's sure to get under local bloggers' skins, and watch your traffic and rankings soar!

Lesson: There is a wrong  way to winning traffic.
