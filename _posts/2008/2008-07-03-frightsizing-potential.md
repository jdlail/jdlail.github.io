Rightsizing sounds better to corp execs than "panicking," says Ken Doctor, writing about the announcement this week of deep cuts at the L.A. Times. He says a more descriptive term would be "frightsizing." He didn't coin the [term](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=frightsizing&start=0&sa=N), but he hangs it well on newspaper companies.  
  
Doctor, however, does give my employer, [E.W. Scripps](https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/ibd.morningstar.com/quicktake/standard/client/shell/AP707.html?CN=AP707&view=quote&valid=NO&set=new&SITE=TNKNN&SECTION=MONEY_COMPLETE&ticker=ssp&submit_ap=%3E), a "cut kudo" if there can be such a thing.  
  
> Certainly, the New York Times, the Washington Post, McClatchy, Scripps, Gannett and Belo come to mind as companies that are trying hard not to panic, not to frightsize. The cuts at all those companies are real, but you have the sense that there's an appreciation of retaining key assets.

It's a [good read](https://www.contentbridges.com/2008/07/call-it-frights.html).
