I recently was on a panel at a University of Tennessee journalism class with Knoxville blogger [Randy Neal](https://www.knoxviews.com/blog/1) and [Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://www.timesfreepress.com/home/) Executive Editor Tom Griscom.  
  
One of the students, Beth Maynard, wrote a piece that has been posted on the "[Scooping the News](https://www.scoopingthenews.com/2009/12/were-back-how-should-news-media-manage.html)" blog that focuses on one subject that came up: comment management. In fact, there were a number of questions from the students about online comments on news Web sites.  
  
Maynard's piece illustrates some of the differing approaches to dealing with what readers have to say.
