We have a [hashtag](https://www.techforluddites.com/2009/02/the-twitter-hash-tag-what-is-it-and-how-do-you-use-it.html) for the "[Mobile Migration](https://journalists.org/events/event_details.asp?id=145671)" workshop next week. You're coming right?  
  
It's on April 1 at the John Seigenthaler Center in Nashville.  
  
The hashtag is [#ONAMM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ONAMM).  
  
See ya there.
