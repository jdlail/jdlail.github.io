Smart guy Ross Mayfield says [Twitter](https://twitter.com), on the eve of turning one, has hit the [tipping point](https://ross.typepad.com/blog/2007/03/twitter_tips_th.html). I love this buzzword: Continuous Partial Presence. Sounds like something from a Sci-Fi movie. If you're trying to figure what the twitter is about all, Chris Brogan' [5 Ways to Use Twitter for Good](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/5-ways-to-use-twitter-for-good.html) from lifehack.org might get your started. Or Anil Dash's [Consider Twitter](https://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/02/14/consider_twitte). Maybe Dan Blank has it figured out with this headline: [Twitter: Always Feel Important](https://danblank.com/blog/2007/03/11/twitter-always-feel-important/) **_Update:_** Another great [Twitter guide](https://slackermanager.com/2007/03/the-several-habits-of-wildly-successful-twitter-users.html). More on [Twitter](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=twitter&ie=UTF-8&scoring=d) I signed up to see what all the twitter was about. [Add me](https://twitter.com/devanel) as a friend. Do you use Twitter, find it useful in the least? Tags: [Twitter](https://technorati.com/tag/twitter) | [social networks](https://technorati.com/tag/social networks)
