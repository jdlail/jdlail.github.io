[![NCPC](/assets_c/2008/07/ncpc-thumb-150x225.webp)](/images/ncpc.webp)Tough times for a nice museum, the [North Carolina Pottery Center](https://www.news-record.com/content/2008/07/21/article/supporters_nc_pottery_center_needs_100000)..  
  
The decade-old [center](https://www.ncpotterycenter.com/) is in Seagrove, which the AP's Martha Waggoner wrote has "been described as the largest continuing community of European-based potters in the United States. In the mid-1700s, seven families from England settled within a five-mile radius of each other and began producing pottery from locally dug clay, and the area is now home to more than 100 potters."
