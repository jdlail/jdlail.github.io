The interactive arm of [E.W. Scripps](https://www.scripps.com)' newspaper division (which is housed here in Knoxville) is experimenting with a new band-and-bar scene site called [knoxville520](https://www.knoxville520.com).

In my internal shorthand, I call it an "Innosite," a play on the name of the consulting firm Scripps has been working with, [Innosight](https://www.innosight.com/), LLC. It's an interesting experiment in trying to innovate to serve a much-needed market niche locally; see what you think. Congrats to Sara Schwabe, Jay Small, Rich Lacy and all the folks at Northshore working on the project.
