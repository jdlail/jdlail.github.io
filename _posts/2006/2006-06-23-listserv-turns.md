[Eric Thomas](https://www.lsoft.se/corporate/management.asp?bio=1), who created the[L-Soft](https://www.lsoft.se/default.asp) listserver software that's called LISTSERV, noted on the [LISTSERV list owners' forum](https://peach.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0606&L=lstown-l&T=0&P=6983)that today is the software's 20th anniversary and his 40th birthday. A history of the ubiquitous software is [here](https://www.lsoft.se/corporate/history_listserv.asp). If you subscribe to many mailing lists, you're probalby a LISTSERV user. The stuff runs like a tank! Happy birthday to both. And thanks Eric for developing LISTSERV.
