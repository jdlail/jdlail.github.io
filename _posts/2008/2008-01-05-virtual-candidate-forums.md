At the blog, [Knoxify](https://knoxify.com/), candidates _are_ addressing the blog's three questions for hopeful officeholders ([more details](/2008/01/question-please.html)). For me, the first two are but warm-ups for the real question, No. 3, _What 5 things could you not live without?_  
  
Ah, we can tell when you're faking it It's kind of fun. Give Knoxify a visit.  
  
At knoxnews, we've been rolling out our series of candidate [video interviews](https://video.ap.org/v/Default.aspx?partner=en-ap&t=m1199302714023&ns=TNKNN_Gallery&p=2008+candidates&f=TNKNN&mk=en-ap&sf=&sd=), about two minutes or so with a candidate. News Sentinel Editor Jack McElroy [explains](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/dec/30/mcelroy-jack-mcelroy-changes-2008/).
