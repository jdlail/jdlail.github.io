An excellent and in-depth [explanation](https://searchengineland.com/071109-090259.php) of Feedburner subscriber and reach stats, and why they go up and down from day-to-day.  
  
This is a better description of Feedburner stats than I've been able to find on Feedburner's site. Good stuff!  
  
Oh yeah, subscribe [to my feed](https://feeds.jacklail.com/randommumblings).
