After a week of tragedy at Virginia Tech, it would be nice to have a world like the [lyrics](https://www.leoslyrics.com/listlyrics.php?hid=rI8Z5FXruoU%3D) of the country song, "A Little Good News:" _There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band One more sad story's one more than I can stand Just once how I'd like to see the headline say "Not much to print today, can't find nothin' bad to say", ..._ Written by Charles Black, Rory Bourke, and Thomas Rocco The [BR549](https://www.br5-49.com/site.php) version, not Anne Murray's!
