There's been an on-and-off again debate about reader comments, how to manage them, whether real names should be required, should there be moderation and more. Comments have been generally supported as allowing reader interactivity or participation and (buzzwords of buzzwords) increasing engagement.  
  
The New York Times is even promoting them [at times](https://www.mathewingram.com/work/2007/10/14/should-comments-be-part-of-the-news/) to the front page of the Web site.
