Psst ... here's how [Charlene Li](https://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2006/09/listen_up_marke.html) of Forrester Research says you can reach the elusive 18-26 market.

> One key data point that stood out for me: 24% of Gen Yers read blogs, which is twice as often as the 12% of Gen Xers (ages 27-40) and three times the 7% of Young Boomers (ages 41-50) that read blogs. So skeptics of blogs should suspend their disbelief and look to at least one bellweather demographic to get an idea of how widespread blog readership can potentially grow in the future.

It's really dumbfounding how many people dismiss blogs as over hyped by the media -- even as traditional media has been slow to effectively adapt the trend it ballyhoos.
