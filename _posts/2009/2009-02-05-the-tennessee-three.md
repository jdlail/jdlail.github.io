[Rex Hammock](https://www.rexblog.com/), [Christian Grantham](https://www.christiangrantham.com/) and [Michael Silence](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence) discussing commenting, journalism and the future. Yeah, no one was running a bar tab. This is from their blogging panel on Friday, Jan. 30, 2009, at the Freedom Forum in Nashville. It was part of [ONA Nashville](https://journalists.org/news/22481/ONA-Nashville-Journalism-does-have-a-future.htm).
