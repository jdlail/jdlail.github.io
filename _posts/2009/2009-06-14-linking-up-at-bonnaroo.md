While I wasn't at Bonnaroo, the mega music festival in Manchester, Tenn., I did some "link journalism" around it that I think added greatly to our coverage. See [here](https://www.knoxville.com/news/2009/jun/14/leaving-bonnaroo-2009-behind/), [here](https://www.knoxville.com/news/2009/jun/11/hype-full-volume-bonnaroo/), [here](https://www.knoxville.com/news/2009/jun/11/061109webroolinks2/), [here](https://www.knoxville.com/news/2009/jun/12/getting-hot-bonnaroo/) and [here](https://www.knoxville.com/news/2009/jun/13/bonnarro-friday-night-phish-saturday-afternoon-jim/). If you're not dong links as news content you're missing a great content resource.  
  
It was just part of an overall coverage package.  
  
Online producer Lauren Spuhler did great "covering" Bonnarroo mostly on her cell phone via our Twitter account [@bonnaroonews](https://twitter.com/bonnaroonews) as well as [writing and shooting videos](https://www.knoxville.com/staff/lauren-spuhler/), some with our [cell phone on Qik.com](https://qik.com/knoxnews).  A large percentage of our coverage was on Twitter, the best way to reach the actual people at the festival.  
  
(The Twitter stream for [#bonnaroo](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23bonnaroo) was incredible.)  
  
We have on Knoxville.com a special section of [all our Bonnaroo coverage](https://www.knoxville.com/news/bonnaroo/), In addition to writing articles for print, [Wayne Bledsoe blogged](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/bledsoe) (where he posted several videos), and Saul Young posted on the "[Forgive Us Our Lens](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/photo/)." the photo staff blog (oh, yeah, he wasn't "working").  
  
Randall Brown also kept our Twitter account [@KnoxvilleDotCom](https://twitter.com/knoxvilledotcom) flowing even through he was in Knoxville with plentiful "retweets."  
  
They did some great stuff!
