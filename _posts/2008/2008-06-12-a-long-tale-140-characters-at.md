On what Ron Sylvester learned from [Twittering a trial](https://www.spj.org/blog/blogs/tech/archive/2008/06/12/20693.aspx).  
  
> One day, I cut and pasted all my "tweet" updates into a traditional story file.  It measured 80 inches.  Now, I don't think anyone would have read an 80-inch story from the newspaper on this trial, as compelling as it was. My editors certainly wouldn't have run a story that long.  But what I found is that people will read an 80-inch story, given to them a paragraph at a time, 140 characters long.
