Noticed on [Michael Silence's](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2005/09/a_rocky_top_str_68.shtml) blog, [Katie Allison Granju's](https://katieallisongranju.blogspot.com/2005/09/red-state-reader.html) and Bob Stepno's that former News Sentinel reporter Jesse Fox Mayshark has started a ezine, [The Red State Reader](https://www.redstatereader.com/). Best of luck to you, Jesse. It will be interesting to see how it develops.
