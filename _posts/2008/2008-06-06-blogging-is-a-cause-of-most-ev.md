Just when I was all convinced I could blame blogging on weight gain, sleep disorders and other maladies of my unhealthful living, [Rex Hammock](https://www.rexblog.com/2008/06/05/17700/) points to an article in the [June issue](https://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-healthy-type) of Scientific American that says blogging may actually have therapeutic value for serious ailments.  
  
> "Whatever the underlying causes may be, people coping with cancer diagnoses and other serious conditions are increasingly seeking--and finding--solace in the blogosphere. 'Blogging undoubtedly affords similar benefits" to expressive writing, says Nancy Morgan (the author of a major study on the subject), who wants to incorporate writing programs into supportive care for cancer patients.'"

In April, the New York Times in "[In Web World of 24/7 Stress, Writers Blog Till They Drop](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/technology/06sweat.html)" said:  
  
> Other bloggers complain of weight loss or gain, sleep disorders, exhaustion and other maladies born of the nonstop strain of producing for a news and information cycle that is as always-on as the Internet.  
>

Tish Grier had some [good commentary on that one](https://spap-oop.blogspot.com/2008/04/if-blogging-doesnt-kill-you.html).  
  
So now we know: Blogging will make you lose weight, gain weight, cause stress, make you calm, help you become a millionaire, lead to you being fired from your job, improve your sex life, cause you to have no sex life, bore you to tears, make you laugh until tears come to your eyes, enlighten you and terribly misinform you.  
  
Did I miss something?  
  
I'm glad we've cleared that up by Friday.
