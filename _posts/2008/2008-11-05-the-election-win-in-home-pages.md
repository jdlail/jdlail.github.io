![3004726317_385c68b464_t.jpg](/images/3004726317_385c68b464_t.webp)Michael Wender has done a [neat collage](https://flickr.com/photos/michaelwender/3004726317/) of news Web site home pages on the Obama victory. Instead of newspaper front pages, it's Web site home pages!  
  
I still don't know how someone will hold up a Dewey beats Truman Web page. Wave their iPhone?
