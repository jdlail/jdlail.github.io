[![Andrew Johnson Hotel](/assets-c/2010/11/Andrew-johnson-hotel-1941-tn1-thumb-250x261-609.webp)](/images/Andrew-johnson-hotel-1941-tn1.webp)In my Google Alerts over the weekend was a piece from the Arcane Radio Trivia blog on the history of WNOX.  
  
It reminded me of Knoxville's rich radio history, particularly with WNOX, [the first radio station in Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNOX) (yes the first) and the 10th (or the eighth depending on who is counting) in the nation.  
  
It is also interesting that it was started by a [16-year-old](https://knoxvilleradiohistory.blogspot.com/2007/03/990-history.html).  
  
Here's a [bit of the history](https://tenwatts.blogspot.com/2006/04/were-number-10.html):  
  
> In 1935 WNOX was sold to the E.W. Scripps Company which also owned the local newspaper, the Knoxville Sentinel. The Scripps Company hired announcer [Lowell Blanchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Blanchard) in 1936 to and told him to hire more hillbilly performers. It was probably their plan to compete better with the upstart [WROL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WROL "WROL"). He began the variety program called the Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round. It became an institution. It mixed comedy, dixieland, swing and live Hillbilly performers. It was not a pure country program by any stretch but it went head-to-head with the Farm and Home Hour on WROL. In 1936 it's star [Roy Acuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Acuff "Roy Acuff") quit to work at WROL. They were now rivals, not just competitors.That would last into the 1940s.  In March 1941, WROL moved to 620 AM;  they changed calls to WATE and began doing more news.

The station helped start the careers of [Archie Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Campbell "Archie Campbell"), Homer and Jethro, Roy Acuff and many others. One of the homes of the station was the [Andrew Johnson Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Johnson_Building "Andrew Johnson Building") shown here in a photo taken around 1941.  
  
Local journalist and author [Ed Hooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Hooper "Ed Hooper") published a book about the WNOX in 2009: [Knoxville's WNOX (Images of America)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738566535?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0738566535)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0738566535). The station in its heyday was said to have a range from New York City to Daytona Beach, Fla.
