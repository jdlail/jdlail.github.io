> ... the future of media is being split into two streams: one that consists of raw news that comes like a torrent from sources such as Twitter, mobile messages and photos, the other, from old media. The eyewitness dispatches (and photos) via social media are an adjunct to the more established media -- which needs to focus on providing analysis, context, and crucially, intelligence -- in real time. And yet it is old media -- and their next-generation counterparts, the blogs and other Internet outlets -- that will have to adapt to this. Of course, the biggest adaption will need to come from the public, those of us who aren't there ourselves.
