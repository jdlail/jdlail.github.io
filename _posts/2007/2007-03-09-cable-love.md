Steve Safran at Lost Remote is just another guy feeling [totalliy Comcastic](https://www.lostremote.com/2007/03/08/how-comcast-has-me-stuck-in-a-comfy-trap/) these days. My co-worker Lauren could relate to his tale. My only issue is whether they'll bury the cable they left in my yard months ago before mowing season. Have you ever noticed that replacing the cable is one of the "most dos" on any service call.
