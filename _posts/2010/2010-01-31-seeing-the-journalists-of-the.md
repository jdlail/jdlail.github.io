I spent most of last week at Hampton University at [Scripps Career Days](https://scrippsdays.com/). The students I met were extremely bright and they have a wonderful facility to work in at the Scripps Howard School of Journalism and Communications. There are links to more coverage, including photos and videos, of the week at the [ScrippsDays.com Web site](https://scrippsdays.com/).
