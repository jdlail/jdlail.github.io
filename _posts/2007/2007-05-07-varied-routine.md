Varied the routine a little this week. Instead of one short, two medium and one long session, I did two short, and three medium sessions. Looks like I lost 1.5 pounds last week. Here's what this week looked like:     **Sessions****Calories burned** **Time exercising** **Miles jogged/Eliptical  
**  **Actual** 5 2532 3:37 12.53  **Target** 4 2000 3:15 No advice   The month-to-date miles is 12.53. Tags: [jogging](https://technorati.com/tag/jogging) | [fatbloggers](https://technorati.com/tag/fatbloggers) | [jason calacanis](https://technorati.com/tag/jason calacanis)
