Tuesday evening Forbes magazine published its second  "Web Celebs 25."  
  
What's a Web Celeb? Forbes says its a person famous primarily for creating or appearing in Internet-based content, and for being highly recognizable to a Web-based audience.  
  
At No. 21 is [Glenn Reynolds](https://www.instapundit.com/) of Knoxville, of whom Forbes says:  
  
> [![Glenn Reynolds](/images/webceleb_21-thumb-150x182.webp)](/images/webceleb_21.webp)By day, Glenn Reynolds is the Beauchamp Brogan Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Tennessee, and an expert in space and technology law. His opinions have appeared in publications ranging from The Columbia Law Review to The Harvard Journal of Law and Technology. But to most of the world, he's better known as the voice of Instapundit--a hugely popular political blog with a libertarian spin. In 2006, he published a book, An Army of Davids: How Markets and Technology Empower Ordinary People to Beat Big Media, Big Government, and Other Goliaths. With his wife, forensic psychologist Dr. Helen Smith, he produces a weekly podcast, The Glenn and Helen Show.

See the [complete list](https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/18/internet-fame-celebrity-tech-cx_de_07webceleb_1218land.html)  Reynolds dropped from No. 7 [last year](/2007/01/a-mocktech-cele.html) to No. 21, but just staying in the list is a feat. Nearly half of last year's list weren't worthy of the list this year. Some of the [dropoffs were surprising](https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/18/internet-fame-celebrity-tech-cx_avb_07webceleb_1218dropoffs_slide_2.html?thisspeed=20000).
