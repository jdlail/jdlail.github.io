Continuing to catchup, [John Battelle](https://battellemedia.com/archives/003033.php) introduced me to [Ms Dewey](https://www.msdewey.com/), a sexy search site apparently put up by Microsoft to promote its new live search. She's flirtatious and funny. I searched for Knoxville, Ms. Dewey says:

> "It's amazing how much people get paid to do stupid things."

An apparent reference to Johnny Knoxville. I searched for baseball, Ms. Dewey says:

> "In baseball I've noticed the balls are getting smaller with steroids and all."

Ms. Dewey is actress [Janina Gavankar](https://www.janinagavankar.com/main/) \-- one beautiful lady. If you haven't visited with Ms. Dewey, do drop in. Tags: [Ms. Dewey](https://technorati.com/tag/ms. dewey) | [Janina Gavankar](https://technorati.com/tag/janina gavankar)
