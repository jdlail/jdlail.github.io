Whew, what a mystery. ECU Baseball Coach Randy Mazey is axed by AD Terry Holland for unspecified reasons.

> “We’re going to continue to go down that road where you’re going to ask me things that I’m forced to say ‘no comment’ on."

\-- Terry Holland See coverage [here](https://www.bonesville.net/Articles/BethanyBradsher/2005/10/101205_Bradsher.htm) and [here](https://www.bonesville.net/Articles/OtherArticles/Bonesville/NN/2005/10/101105_NN.htm). Mazey, a Clemson grad, was a one-time assistant at the Unviersity of Tennessee.
