Steve Outing, whose has got something going with [Techgrl](https://www.techgrl.com/) and who has a nice start with [growingyournewswebsite.com](https://www.growingyournewswebsite.com/), has yet another site in development, [ReinventingClassifieds.com](https://www.reinventingclassifieds.com/).  
  
He's looking for people in classifieds or at media companies who make strategy decisions involving classifieds and advertising to [take his survey](https://classifieds.managerssurvey.sgizmo.com/).  
  
Consultants, academics, etc. who have expertise in the classifieds sector also are invited take the survey.  
  
If you fit the bill, take the survey. I'm sure the learnings from his site will benefit anyone interested in this vital part of the newspaper (print and online) revenue pie.
