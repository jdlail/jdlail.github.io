This week my exercise music was the [John Butler Trio's](https://www.johnbutlertrio.com/) Grand National, the video above is the cut "Good Excuse." More YouTube videos [of the band](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=john+butler+trio).  
  
Maybe everybody knows about this group; they been releasing albums since 2001. I didn't, but I have the "old fogey" excuse. They're an Australian roots/jam band group. They're big in Australia and have had hits in France and Japan. In the US, they've been on Leno and Letterman and toured with Dave Matthews and John Mayer. The latest release, Grand National, came out in March. More on [the band and its history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Butler_Trio).  
  
Good stuff. I would love to see them play the Tennessee Theatre.  
  
It was a good week exercising, too.
