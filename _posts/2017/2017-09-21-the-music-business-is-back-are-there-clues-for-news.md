The music business has been growing for the last few years after going into a decline in 1999. And it doesn't have to do [with buying MP3s](https://www.recode.net/2017/9/20/16339484/music-streaming-riaa-spotify-apple-music-youtube-2017-revenue-subscription). The news and music industries have long been compared; they were disrupted by the Internet at about the same time and forever changed. Are there still lessons to be learned between the two industries. Would a "Spotify model" work for news? Some efforts have been tried and failed from traditional media companies, the tech powers that control the platforms and entrepreneurial startups. ![Music Sales by format](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/music-sales.webp)
