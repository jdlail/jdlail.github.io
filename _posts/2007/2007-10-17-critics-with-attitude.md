Oh my!  
  
Greg Sterling on his [encounter with a restaurant](https://gesterling.wordpress.com/2007/10/16/no-yelpers-says-one-local-cafe/) that has posted a sign that says "No Yelpers."  
  
Snarky! Imagine that.  
  
Could this be UCG backlash?  
  
To work, users reviews aggregated have to approach the truth to be valuable to the community using them. Buyers/user/patron reviews are powerful influencers of behavior. But what of trolls, people with a vendetta and people who just get it wrong?  
  
Interesting debate.
