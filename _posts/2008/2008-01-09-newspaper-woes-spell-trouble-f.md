The newspaper industry's troubles have even stung the [National Spelling Bee](https://www.spellingbee.com/), where [some schools seem to be struggling](https://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2008/jan/03/nk-school-district-commits-to-finding-funds-for/) to come up with the money for a $99 entrance fee needed because newspaper sponsorships are down.  
  
Gee, without the bee, how will we find those kids that can spell s-e-r-r-e-f-i-n-e and y-o-s-e-n-a-b-e.
