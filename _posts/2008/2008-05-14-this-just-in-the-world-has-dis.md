The world has now discovered Twitter ... so it's ok to [follow me](https://twitter.com/jacklail). By the way, shortly after I watched this, Twitter went down and it's still not operating quite correctly. Random power!  
  
The above is also an example of the new embed code in the Scripps' "Flaven" player (beats me). Now you can put knoxnews videos on your site like this [RandomThis video](https://www.knoxnews.com/videos/detail/what-are-you-doing/). The "link" link is on the right hand side of the player.
