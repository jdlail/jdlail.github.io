MEDIALIFE has a nice, short [piece](https://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_5992.asp) on the "hotbeds of experimentation" in the newspaper industry and some of the interesting things going on. Here's a graph:

> "I really think one of the biggest challenges for us in the newspaper industry is to figure out how to aggregate better, and that's really counter-intuitive for us old print guys. You have to make peoples' lives easier and more effective, and the only way to do that is to make web surfing easier and more effective for them. The sites that are most successful on the web are the ones that aggregate."

\-- Ken Sands, online publisher, [Spokesman-Review](https://www.spokesmanreview.com/) in Spokane, Wash. And separately, journalism educator [Mindy McAdams](https://mindymcadams.com/) points to one successful looking experiment in [Bakersfield](https://tojou.blogspot.com/2006/07/hyperlocal-successes.html).
