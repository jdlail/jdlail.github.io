I've seen a lot of thoughtful react to Jason Calacanis' weekend post about [Facebook bankruptcy](https://www.calacanis.com/2007/07/28/social-network-exhaustion-or-facebook-bankruptcy-redux/), but [Ethan Kaplan](https://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2007/07/28/a-vc-declaring-bankruptcy/) has the best two sentences I've read:

> You all, and we all, made a system in which the promiscuous exchange of data is the predicate for it functioning. Do not complain about reaping what you sowed.

In classic Calacanis style, he whipped up a blogosphere tornado trying to come to grips with the overload of his Facebook account after being sick for a few days. His [Kudzu](https://www.kudzuworld.com/Kudzu/index.EN.aspx) of Connections piece whirled and whipped about on an otherwise lazy summer Saturday. For a longer react piece, I'd recommend Rex Hammock's [Jason decides Facebook is not the golden fleece](https://www.rexblog.com/2007/07/28/17079/). He's been writing and thinking alot about Facebook and other social netwroks. But there's lots more [react](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=jason+calacanis+and+facebook). Is [Robert Scoble](https://scobleizer.com/2007/07/28/calacanis-cant-keep-up-with-facebook/) right when he says: _Facebook is the new business card AND the new media distribution network_? If it is, add me to your [Rolodex](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=539056144).
