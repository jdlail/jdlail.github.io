Bloggers and story commenters had one double-entendre after another and no end of snarky comments about the GVX story Tuesday headlined "[Police quiz UT center McNeil, charge three women found in his bed](https://www.govolsxtra.com/news/2007/nov/06/police-quiz-ut-center-mcneil-charge-three-women-fo/)."  
  
But this quote on the [Get the Picture](https://blutarsky.wordpress.com/2007/11/06/sex-and-drugs-and-rock-and-roll/) blog, written by a Georgia Dawg fan, is one of the most creative images:  
  
> Look at Knoxville as the Playboy Mansion South, and (Tennessee Coach Phillip) Fulmer as a very large, very orange Hugh Hefner, and it all begins to make sense. _Strange_ sense, maybe, but sense…  
>

Now that is truly bizarrely funny.
