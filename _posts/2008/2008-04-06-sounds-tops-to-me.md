_Oh yeah!_ Random Mumblings has been added to the [journalism section](https://journalism.alltop.com/) of Web startup aggregator alltop. Hanging with some of my favs in the journalism area.  
  
[Alltop](https://www.alltop.com/) is a project of Nononina, Inc., which does another site I like, [Truemors](https://www.truemors.com/).  
  
Nononina CEO [Guy Kawasaki](https://blog.guykawasaki.com/) told [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/businesswire/feeds/businesswire/2008/03/11/businesswire20080311005611r1.html):  
  
> "Alltop is an 'online magazine rack' that displays the news from the top publications and blogs. Our goal is to satisfy the information needs of the 99% of Internet users who will never use an RSS feed reader or create a custom home page. Think of it as aggregation without the aggravation."

Ah, I think that means it's pretty cool.  
  
In addition to well known blogger, venture capitalist and former Apple exec Kawasaki, Nononina is Will Mayall amd Kathryn Henkens.  
  
Check it out; they have good taste. I'm sure of it.
