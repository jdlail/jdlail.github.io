Somehow I totally missed this [Tennessee tale](https://valleywag.com/tech/exclusive/fark-founder-accuses-fox-newsman-of-hacking-290286.php).

Drew Curtis, founder of the hugely popular "news" site [Fark.com](https://www.fark.com/), says the new media manager of a Memphis Fox TV station tried to hack his site.

Curtis has done e-mail interviews with Mediaverse, a Memphis media blog, and ValleyWag, the Silicon Valley alpha-attitude gossip blog.

Curtis says he's got Darrell Phillips of [WHBQ Fox13](https://www.myfoxmemphis.com/myfox/) 99.9 nailed.

The Fark founder says deceptive emails were sent to him and several Fark employees or volunteers in an effort to get them to unwittingly download a piece of Trojan Horse software that communicated back to a computer in Memphis with captured passwords and user ids. Efforts were made to hack into Fark's servers.

Curtis wrote [Mediverse](https://mediaverse-memphis.blogspot.com/2007/08/on-getting-farked-999-percent.html):

> "Our chances of being wrong are close to nil. Even with the information we currently have we're standing at 99.9%. Our data indicates that only one individual was using the dphillips Fark account for the entire time it's been in existence. That individual worked at Fox, used a verizon wireless card, and a comcast cable modem account in the Memphis area."

Here are some links:

That is totally bizarre. Must be the Memphis heat.
