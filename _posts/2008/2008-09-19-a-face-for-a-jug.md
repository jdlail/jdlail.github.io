[Dan Traveling](https://www.youtube.com/user/dmccoig) has done a video on a couple of my favorite potters, Terry and Anna King of King's Pottery outside of Seagrove, NC. Fine folks. I think I was in the same high school graduating class as Terry at Southwestern Randolph High School.  
  
Dan McCoig does some of the best videos I've seen of life in the rural South, focusing mostly on North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. He's laid back enough to let his subjects tell their stories.
