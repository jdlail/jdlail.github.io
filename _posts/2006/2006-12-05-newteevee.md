Om Malik's new blog [NewTeeVee](https://newteevee.com/2006/12/04/welcome-to-newteevee/) will be must reading. I've already discovered "[praying mantis girl](https://my.break.com/Media/View.aspx?ContentID=156255)" and [Kent Nichols' Ask a Ninja](https://askaninja.com/). Maybe, NewTeeVee will discover the [Randoms](https://web.knoxnews.com/special/randomthis/), whose weekly video features are gems on KnoxNews.com. They rock -- every week. Or maybe our use of $99 cameras from Target to do news videos like [this](https://www.knoxnews.com/kns/traffic/article/0,1406,KNS_358_5175661,00.html) Good luck to Om and his editorial team on the new blog. It'll be one of my daily reads. Tags: [NewTeeVee](https://technorati.com/tag/newteevee) | [Om Malik](https://technorati.com/tag/Om+Malik)
