Scripps-owned Shopzilla is in the news in a [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/04/technology/04ecom.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=business&adxnnlx=1165237809-CJjzVlGy1SAfSh3CNos6cw) piece on a trio of upstarts who hope to challenge the current big players in comparison shopping sites (Shopzilla, Shopping.com and PriceGrabber). The article boils down to a business model discussion of pay-per-click advertising vs. pay-per-performance advertising. Meanwhile Nielsen//Netratings said Shopzilla was the No. 9 shopping destination on CyberMonday at U.S. Workplaces and was the first comparison shopping site on the list (via [Center for Media Research](https://www.centerformediaresearch.com/cfmr_brief.cfm?fnl=061204)).

And today (12/4/2006), according to [Coremetrics](https://www.webadvantage.net/tip_archive.cfm?tip_id=513&&a=1), will really be the top online shopping day of the holiday season. That firm has spun up the term "eDay" for this Monday and estimates online sales will be 19 percent ahead of last year. The other big days? Coremetrics says the next four largest days will be the Monday one week after eDay, the Wednesday after eDay, the Tuesday after eDay, and the Tuesday one week after eDay. Maybe a good day to ask, where do newspaper Web sites fit into this picture? For most, I suspect, the advertising revenue derived from either pay-per-click or pay-per-performance holiday season shopping ad campaigns is minimal. Are there success stories?
