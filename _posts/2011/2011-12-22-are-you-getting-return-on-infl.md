Friend and fellow Knoxville resident Mark Schaefer has a new book coming out in March on social media and marketing called _Return on Influence!_..  
  
And he's got a [special offer](https://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?llr=7kbaptcab&v=001Mo1LsqllbCCscME3tWFPfTvDJb2PQIU7_TzNNNWgR4fD0dsrDQrALjn_oEaDh9DyX19wH3AQ2fBPOzzoUNfkPuoiOyuSL7YJdCN9dZ_UEDJBaEHYG5Zckvr9v6OySCfOtpej2GRDpvxljV0uziXo38f-KnpO0k_nKwFbdH3VhXGgLpDeI1B_o46ge27F9F8eSKgKqbepGNjnno4suikWyuzShWxrkfCbjgLxIsaKXALPrKZV7oFZF3wzEiLk0KavaTFF8lc6BUeehKm11BBlrVZUA5WUeoaJuhqEx6ySIHXEcE53KtXmoTyby-4vTBAB70MXB6L4AEfJ4nXdBpL2zih8VEs9JxejnwfLlwV7UOJ8Ch9U23Et4JaYDKCbvJ0J).
