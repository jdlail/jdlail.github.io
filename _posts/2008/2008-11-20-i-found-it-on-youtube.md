NAA Beth Lawton looks at [YouTube and newspapers](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/roll/2008/11/we-can-be-found-on-youtube.html). She links to a neat Google map of [newspapers with YouTube channels](https://10000words.net/newspapers-on-youtube.html).  
  
Having a presence on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/knoxnews) is a no-brainer to me, but apparently it's controversial in spots. How many times have you heard someone say: "I found it on YouTube." It's a lot easier to adjust to the consumer's behavior than to teach the consumer to adjust to your behavior.  
  
It reminds me a bit of the debate about whether being in Google News was good for news sites.
