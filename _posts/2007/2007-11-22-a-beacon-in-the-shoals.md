Obviously, a lot of people from MoveOn.org to the other end of the political spectrum are weighing in negatively on the [Facebook Beacon](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=%22facebook+beacon%22&btnG=Search+Blogs). But when it's wigging out smart people like Forrester's [Charlene Li](https://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2007/11/close-encounter.html), ... uh ... it might be time to rethink.  
  
Soon it'll be more popular than pop up ads.
