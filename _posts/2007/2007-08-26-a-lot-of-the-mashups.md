A lot of the "mashups" (a web application combing data from more than one source) I see only cover San Francisco or California or maybe just a few major metro areas, but here's one that includes data on Knoxville -- and it's useful too.  
  
[Vision 20/20](https://www.thevision2020.com/) has created a nationwide sexual offender database/map mashup.  
  
Go to [the map search](https://locator.thevision2020.com/) and enter Knoxville for city and TN for state. You might be surprised.  
  
The [company](https://www.thevision2020.com/aboutus.aspx), which says it is committed to "Peace of Mind" products, frames this one [around](https://www.thevision2020.com/LocateSexOffenders.aspx):  
  
> There are 650,000 registered sex offenders in America - and that number grows by about 25,000 every year. Wouldn't you like to know if any of them are living in your neighborhood?
