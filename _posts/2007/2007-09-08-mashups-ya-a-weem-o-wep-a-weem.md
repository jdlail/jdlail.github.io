A pretty amazing campaign mashup of where the [presidential candidates are traveling](https://www.mapthecandidates.com/about/) complete with Youtube videos of their speeches there.  
  
The site says:

> Map the Candidates is a nonpartisan site that tracks the presidential candidates' campaign stops across the country. Utilizing public schedules provided by the campaigns, we publish an ongoing digest of where the candidates were, are, and will be. MTC's aim is to bring people and technology together to offer a new, customizable look at America's digital democracy.

But Adrian Holovaty comments on [Marc Hedlund's O'Reilly Radar post](https://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/09/map_the_candida.html) about the mashup that:

> In my previous job at the Washington Post, we put together a site called [Campaign Tracker](https://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/tracker/) that does this and more.  
>
> Browse campaign visits by date, by candidate and by state; get RSS feeds for any candidate or state.  
>
> Of course, there's more to the campaign than where the candidates travel -- the site also has campaign-finance data and coverage of the issues. Powered by Django.

And speaking of mashups, Danny Sanchez has an [impressive roundup of crime maps](https://journalistopia.com/2007/09/06/journalistopias-online-crime-maps-directory/)

And if you into map mashups, here's more from [Google Map Mania](https://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/).

_Mashed Potato, Ya a weem o wep a weem o wep,

Ya, ya ya, ya,
