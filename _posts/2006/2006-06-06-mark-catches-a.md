[![Marks' fish](/images/markfish800-thumb.webp)](/images/markfish800.webp)

We went on a fishing charter during vacation and Mark caught a fish, a [Bontia](https://www.madfishcharters.com/species.htm)that weighted maybe 12 pounds. I broke a reel and several got away when they went under the boat and cut the line.

I did a catch a couple, but there are no photos. Only Mark has any evidence we caught anything! We released our catches.  Our captain was [John Peel](https://www.fishingpalmbeach.com/), who was very knowledgeable and found the fish. One thing I didn't know to ask, but would now is:

How did he hook the domain name fishingpalmbeach.com? Seems like a good one.
