And here [they are](https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/Untangling_the_Web.pdf) in over 600 pages. The back story about the PDF from [Wired](https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/05/nsa-manual-on-hacking-internet/), which says the e-book got released as a result of a Freedom of Information request (thanks Sunshine) filed in April.

Some of the stuff is out of date, but much of it is not and the tricks and tips are useful and insightful. (See the Google Hacks section).

Here's a site and page it references (although the URL has changed) for the [math-challenged journalist](https://soople.com/soople_intcalchome.php) (yes, all of you)
