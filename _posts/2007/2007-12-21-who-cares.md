[Scandal fatigue](https://www.knoxviews.com/node/6564) or just maybe people [don't care about local government](https://oatneyworld.blogspot.com/2007/12/not-fatigue-just-apathy.html)?  
  
Those are two theories from a couple of Knoxville area bloggers who usually only agree that they are both passionate about news and politics.  
  
They are reacting to radio talk show host George Korda's column about an "[interesting lack of interest](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/dec/17/korda-interesting-lack-interest/)" in grilling County Commission Chair Scott Moore on the various county scandals and shenanigans.  
  
It's not like it has been ignored by the news media.
