Jay Small has [a smart take](https://smallinitiatives.com/node/1141) on the similarity of Twitter's audience retention woes and those of local news sites:  
  
> The consumer value of a social-status service like Twitter resembles the value of "news" as a service. It is incidentally important, but not always important, and never all important to any one person. The intervals between incidents that you or I might deem important defy any prediction.  
>
> Does that mean we in local media should hope Twitter finds a great business model to capitalize on its traffic, since it so resembles ours? Hmm. Maybe. I find it easier (though not completely easy) to connect those dots than the ones between us and, say, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple or eBay.
