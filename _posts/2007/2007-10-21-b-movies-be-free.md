[![Bmovies Sci-fi photo](/images/bmoviesscifi-thumb-188x137.webp)](/images/bmoviesscifi.webp) A local business blog has has some [insights](https://www.knoxvillebusiness.com/knoxville-business-blog.html#B-Movies-Earn-Local-Company-an-A-for-Entrepreneurship) to an interesting new Web venture in KnoxVegas, [bmovies.com](https://www.bmovies.com/) from DMGX.  
  
It launched Oct. 5 without advertising or SEM, but is attracting viewers rapidly.  
  
Wade Austin of [DMGX](https://www.dmgx.com/) says:

Pop some popcorn, grab a Coke and check it out.  
  
And his biz plan of $400,000 a month in advertising when it reaches 1 million views per month vs $15,000 in server costs gives free a pretty good profit margin.  
  
_Good luck!_
