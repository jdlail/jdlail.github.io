[John Temple,](https://www.johntemple.net/) last editor of the [Rocky Mountain News](https://www.rockymountainnews.com/ "Rocky Mountain News") takes a look in a piece in [Atlantic magazine](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/02/life-after-death-two-years-since-the-demise-of-my-newspaper/71686/) at what has happened to his former staff two years after the closing of the newspaper. Temple wrote:  
  
> A survey I just conducted of the 194 members of the paper's editorial staff on its last day found that the blow of losing a job doesn't mean life is going to be worse down the road. My survey wasn't scientific. It's possible that those who didn't respond are struggling personally or financially more than those who did. But the 146, or 75 percent, who did respond have lessons for journalists and others who fear the instability of their jobs or who may have suffered a similar fate.
