Stephen Bagg at [Compete](https://blog.compete.com/2007/04/05/craigslist-popular-categories/) says:

> Analysis of eight major American cities shows erotic services consistently garners the highest number of individual visitors for February – almost always twice as many as the next ranking category, averaging 265,000 people per city. Equally racy lists that consistently score high visitor volume are the section for casual encounters as well as personals for women seeking men. The most commonly frequented venue outside of this virtual red-light district? Cars for sale.

Oh, yeah? That got [Scott Karp](https://publishing2.com/2007/04/05/craigslist-openness-vs-newspaper-trust/) to opine: "TRUST is the only reason to choose a familiar local newspaper brand over Craigslist" for intimacy. Personals were the first print classified category I can think of to be decimated by Online, but it wasn't Craigslist. I think it was AOL chat rooms, and a host of personal online sites. There wasn't a lot of handwringing at the time, but it did portend of what is in the wind. Is the trust factor there for newspapers? Is it enough to overcome the sexy in Craigslist? Maybe, but newspapers still need a makeover. _If you want my body and you think I'm sexy Come on, sugar, let me know If you really need me just reach out and touch me Come on, honey, tell me so, ooohooo \-- 1978, Carmine Appice and Rod Stewart_ Tags: [craigslists](https://technorati.com/tag/craiglists) | [newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/newspapers) | [classifieds](https://technorati.com/tag/classifieds) | [personals](https://technorati.com/tag/personals)
