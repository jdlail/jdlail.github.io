Maybe there's something to this Kindle thing. [People willing to pay for news content](https://russmcbee.com/archive/2009/03/15/thoughts-on-the-kindle-2.aspx) who wouldn't subscribe to a print newspaper. And [geeks](https://www.knoxviews.com/node/10678) like it.  
  
Remember, we're at version two. Most technology products don't really get prime time until version 3. Hey, I'm not into the Kool-Aid so far as to believe it's the answer, but it could one be one of many needed answers.
