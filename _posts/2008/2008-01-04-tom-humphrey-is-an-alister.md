![Tom Humphrey](/images/humphreytomclr__t100.webp)Chris Cillizza, who writes "[The Fix](https://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2007/12/clip_n_save_the_best_state_pol.html)" blog on the Washington Post Web site, asked people to send in suggestions on the best political reporters in each state and created a list in a Dec. 28 blog posting.  
   
For Tennessee, there is Knoxville News Sentinel reporter Tom Humphrey and Tennessee Journal editor Ed Cromer.  
  
Having worked with "Ole Tom" for years, I couldn't agree more with his selection. Some reporters in other states were also some of the best whose work I know of.  
   
It's an A-list of reporters covering politics and government at the state level and a list one-time Unipresser Tom Humphey certainly deserves to be on.
