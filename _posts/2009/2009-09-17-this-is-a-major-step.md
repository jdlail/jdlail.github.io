> An online, searchable database of local candidates' campaign finances could be up and running for public use in time for the August 2010 county primary election, said officials with the Knox County Election Commission.

The initiative is a positive, forward-thinking move by the Knox County Election Commission and may bring at least the level of detail available for state and federal races to the local level.
