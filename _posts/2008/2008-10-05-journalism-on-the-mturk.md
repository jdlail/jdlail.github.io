Wow, [Andy Baio](https://www.depthreporting.com/2008/10/using-amazon-mechanical-turk-to.html) explains how he used [Amazon's Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) program to transcribe an an audio interview. The interview was transcribed in less than three hours for $15.40. He also gives a step-by-step description of how he posted his work request.  
  
That's pretty innovative. Anybody else using Mechanical Turk for journalism related "Human Intelligence Tasks?"  
  
Another attractive looking service that was mentioned in the comments is [podclerk.com](https://www.podclerk.com/). Anybody got feedback on that service?  
  
Mechanical Turk is not without its [criticisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk).
