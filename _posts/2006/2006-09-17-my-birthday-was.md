[![Mark and Jack rafting on the French Broad River](/markandjackrafting-thumb.JPG)](/markandjackrafting.JPG)  
Mark and I went rafting on the French Broad River in North Carolina for my birthday. We're the two in the front. We went with [French Broad Rafting Expeditions](https://www.frenchbroadrafting.com/) just outside Marshall, NC. We took an afternoon five-mile trip. It was fun. The day was beautiful. The water was cold. We didn't fall out.
