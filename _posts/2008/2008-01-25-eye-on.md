![Brittney Gilbert](/images/KPIXBrittneyGilbert.webp)Nashville ex-patriate and pioneering Tennessee blogger Brittney Gilbert's new work gig blog "[Eye on Blogs](https://cbslocalblogs.prospero.com/n/blogs/blog.aspx?webtag=kpix_eyeonblogs)" officially launched Thursday at KPIX in San Francisco. She got some pub in the [trade press](https://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6525137.html?industryid=47174) earlier in the week.  
  
> "If the concept can drive traffic in Nashville, which has a much smaller blogger community, it can certainly work here." The hope is to bring users to cbs5.com who might not ordinarily visit a station Web site.

\-- Internet Operation Manager Jim Parker.  
  
Her departure from WKRN was [highly publicized](/2007/07/a-broadcast-imb.html).  
  
Best of luck in the new project!
