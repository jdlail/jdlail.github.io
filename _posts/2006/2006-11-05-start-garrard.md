Nice seeing former ECU quarterback [David Garrard](https://www.nfl.com/players/playerpage/302027) getting some starts at Jacksonville -- and winning. He's lead the Jags to two victories subbing for injured Bryon Leftwich, including today's 37-7 win over the Titans. _"I'm glad I'm not the coach," safety Deon Grant said. "It would be real hard to sit David down right now and real hard not to put Byron back in there. I guess that's the coach's fault for having two good quarterbacks."  
\-- [Associated Press](https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FBN_TITANS_JAGUARS_TNOL-?SITE=TNKNN&SECTION=SPORTS&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT)_ And remember, Garrard went 4-1 when Leftwich went out last year with a broken ankle in the last five regular-season games. Five years ago, when he was drafted by the Jags, Garrard must have thought he was the franchise's quarterback of the future after then-starting QB Mark Brunell, but there was a coaching change, Marshall's Bryon Leftwich was drafted and proclaimed the QB of the future for Jacksonville. Now, coach Jack Del Rio may have a "quarterback controversy" on his hands with Garrard playing well in his two starts this year. I hope it works out well for Garrard, who was the best East Carolina quarterback since Jeff Blake.
