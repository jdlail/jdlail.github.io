[Tom Abate](https://minimediaguy.org/2006/12/21/ill-see-you-in-the-talking-papers/#more-533) writes about a presentation on the [Ventura Counmty Star's](https://www.venturacountystar.com/) groundbrekaing video efforts. His takeaway on that presentation and some others at UC Berkeley’s New Media program:

> The key to cross-training print journalists as videographers was to get comfortable with the notion that they would make mistakes. Not errors in fact. Not telling viewers there was a fire when it was obviously a flood. But camera shots may be shaky and audio may be “too hot” (loud?) because multimedia storytelling is a learning process — and one that plays out in front of an audience and often on deadline.
