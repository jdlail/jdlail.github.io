Tennessee Gov. [Bill Haslam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Haslam "Bill Haslam") is getting some unfavorable attention in a new video posted Monday by the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/).

The video and a related Web page says that Haslam's move to [exempt himself from finanical disclosure laws](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/01/18/stunning-disregard-for-basic-disclosure-in-tennessee/) is part of  "a disturbing trend of states across the country rolling back transparency of government information and clouding the ability of the public to see what their government and its officials are doing."  
  
The Sunlight Foundation is asking people to sign an open letter (why, of course) to demand they stop the weakening of transparency laws.  
  
What's the Sunlight Foundation? It's "[about page](https://sunlightfoundation.com/about/)" says:  
  
> Sunlight develops and encourages new government policies to make it more open and transparent, facilitates searchable, sortable and machine readable databases, builds tools and websites to enable easy access to information, fosters distributed research projects as an community building tool, engages in advocacy for 21st century laws to require that government make data available in real time and trains thousands of journalists and citizens in using data and the web to watchdog Washington.
