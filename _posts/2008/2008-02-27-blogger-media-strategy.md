The National Rifle Association is getting blogger savvy.  
  
I've heard the politically powerful group has been reaching out to "gun bloggers" in a serious way and this year they'll be able to 'cover" the national convention in Louisville, Ky.  
  
A [Second Amendment Blog Bash](https://www.2ablogbash.com/) will be May 16-18 in conjunction with the NRA convention. [SayUncle](https://www.saysuncle.com/archives/2008/02/27/second_amendment_blog_bash-4/) is among those planning to head to Kentucky and has more info.  
  
The bloggers will get [media credentials](https://www.snowflakesinhell.com/2008/02/27/media-credentials/) and access to the media room.  
  
Pretty smart media strategy! The NRA definitely isn't all NRA caps and pickup gun racks on the backroads.  
  
I wonder how many other organizations are developing media strategies around bloggers?
