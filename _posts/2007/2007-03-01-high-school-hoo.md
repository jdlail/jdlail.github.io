[This](https://citmedia.org/blog/2007/02/28/louisiana-officials-backpedal-on-photo-ban/) is definitely good news. I'm sure a lot of state high school athletic associations would like to see this happen. And if one state association made it stick, others would follow. At the college level, you alerady have the company town system with the schools making the money -- and vigilantly guarding their control. I can see why somebody at the high school level would say we want our own company town. But why would they come up with a rule that depended on whether the photo had been on newsprint?
