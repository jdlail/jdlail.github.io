Dave Morgan of [Tacoda](https://www.tacoda.com/) tells newspapers to wake up:

> . . two things that most newspaper companies lack these days, and if they don't get them fast, they are most certainly dead--a vision and a plan for their own future.

\-- Dave Morgan in [Online Spin](https://publications.mediapost.com/?fuseaction=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=44821) Tags: [Newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/newspapers) | [New Media](https://technorati.com/tag/new media) | [Media](https://technorati.com/tag/media) Morgan lists five things newspapers must do. Here they are in abbreviated form:

* Acknowledge the digital reality
* Develop a comprehensive, long-term plan for your success
* Play to win
* Show patience and resolve
* Listen to your advertisers and your audiences and your shareholders.

Morgan is one of the smartest guys in the online business from his RealMedia days to Tacoda today -- and one who has done business with newspaper companies for years -- so whether you agree with him or not, it's a good message to heed.
