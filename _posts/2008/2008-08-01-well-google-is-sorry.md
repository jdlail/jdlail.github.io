A lot of Tennessee bloggers -- well, and bloggers everywhere -- have been locked out of their blogger.com blogs after flagged as possible spam blogs. But there's good news, Google says they are on it:  
  
> We've noticed that a number of users have had their blogs mistakenly marked as spam, and wanted to sound off real quick to let you know that, despite it being Friday afternoon, we are working hard to sort this out. So to those folks who have received an email saying that your blog has been classified as spam and can't post right now, we offer our sincere apologies for the trouble.
