I made the big switch yesterday from landline POTS telephone to cable digital phone service yesterday. Comcast was cheaper than MCI, which I used for local and long distance, and both offer basically the same set of phone features: Caller ID, call waiting, call waiting Caller ID, three-way calling, web-based voice mail, and a lot of blab, blah stuff I never use plus free nationwide long distance. Other than being over an hour past the 8 a.m. to noon "show up" window, the installer did a great job. He knew what he was doing and quickly move through the process (I was upgrading to digital cable too so I had three cable boxes to get hooked up). All was going well, until ... The office desk had to be moved to access the phone jack that was nearest where I have my 'cable modem" and router. The desk is close to 20 years old and was getting unstable, I knew. "Wait, I said, I'll move it" I took most of the books out to lighten it up a bit. When I moved one end out from the wall, the other end collapsed sending papers, pens, paperclips, nnotebooks, speakers, a boulder of a tube computer monitor, dust and shelves flying. When the avalanche ended, the nonplused tech simply said: "Yeah, I think I can get to it now."
