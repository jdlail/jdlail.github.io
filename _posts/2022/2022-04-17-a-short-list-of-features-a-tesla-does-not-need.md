Tesla has decided to drop the mobile charger as part of the standard accesssories with its all-electric cars.

The [decision was noticed Saturday](https://twitter.com/tesla_adri/status/1515428153870753799) and later confirmed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

The social media reaction came swiftly to news of dropping as standard equipment of the $275 [Gen 2 Mobile Connector Bundle](https://shop.tesla.com/product/gen-2-mobile-connector-bundle), which is, interestingly, out of stock. The company also sells a [Corded Mobile Connector](https://shop.tesla.com/product/corded-mobile-connector), with improved charging speeds from the Gen 2 model, for $400, but it is also out-of-stock.

Later Saturday, Musk tried to drain some energy from the brouhaha, tweeting:

_(Short pause ... wonder what the profit margin is on that item?)_

Twitter users are applying "usage statistics" logic to other features of the car.

Here's a list of features a Tesla doesn't need due to "usage statistics super low."

There you have it, the list of "usage statistics super low" that can be dropped from Teslas.

If you want to follow Tesla news on Twitter, I have [a handy list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1337401561887215616). If you think someone or some source should be added, tweet it at me, [@jacklail](https://twitter.com/jacklail).
