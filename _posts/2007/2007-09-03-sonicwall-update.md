Perhaps, I'm no longer running a porno site.

Until the change in implemented, I'm banned by firms that use SonicWALL's content filtering service, which had rated my site as pornographic. This caused it to be blocked to users of public WiFi at Panera restaurants. I have no clue how I got that rating.  
  
I was alerted in a [comment](/2007/09/banned-from-panera.html#comment-36448) on my original post about a blog, [Antijihadist Tech](https://1389blog.com/category/blog-censorship/) ("Web 2.0 and Tech Savvy for the Counterterrorist Community"), that has a whole campaign going about blog censorship. Check it out.  
  
I'm not a counter-terrorist, either, BTW.
