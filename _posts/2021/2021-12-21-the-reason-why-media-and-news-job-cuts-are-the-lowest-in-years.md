Media and news job cuts this year are expected to hit the lowest level since at least 2008, according to data from Challenger Gray & Christmas reported by the [Axios Media Trends newsletter](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-media-trends-cd57a4ce-26bb-4c48-b459-21bf45e90312.html?chunk=3&utm_term=twsocialshare#story3).

That sounds encouraging -- maybe it actually is - but the reason for the lower number of job losses seems to be so many were let go in 2020. Who was left to lay off?

In 2020 an astounding [16,160 newsroom jobs were lost](https://www.challengergray.com/blog/job-cuts-dec-2020-over-2-3-million-nearly-half-due-to-covid/). Most of happened during the [first half of last year](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/21/a-third-of-large-u-s-newspapers-experienced-layoffs-in-2020-more-than-in-2019/) as pandemic shutdown the economy. (Newsroom jobs are a subset of the media industry.)

Poynter has been [maintaining a list](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2021/here-are-the-newsroom-layoffs-furloughs-and-closures-caused-by-the-coronavirus/) of jobs losses during the pandemic. The Pew Research Center said earlier this year the nunmber of [newsroom jobs](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/13/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-fallen-26-since-2008/) have fallen 26% since 2008 with big declines in newspaper newsrooms and big increases (but not as big as the newspaper declines) in digital-native newsrooms.
