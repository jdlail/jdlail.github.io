I'll be on George Korda's "State Your Case" radio show form 1-3 (eastern) today. The show is on Newstalk 98.7 FM and is [streamed on the web](https://987newstalk.com/).  
  
From, 1-2, I'll be talking about [near-record-low confidence in newspapers and television news](/2010/08/a-distrusted-news-source.html). A recent Gallop organization poll found that those with "a great deal: or "quite a lot" of confidence in newspapers remains at a low level and the percentage dropped to a 20-year low for television news. Some solace, however, was that both rate higher than Congress. Maybe we need to [distribute these](https://www.tomscott.com/warnings/) with each copy?

From 2 to 3 p.m., I'm hanging around as friend and newspaper consultant [Kevin Slimp](https://www.kevinslimp.com/) talks about his recent customer experiences with [Delta Air Lines](/2010/07/oh-no-not-again-delta.html). A frequent traveler to speaking engagements and workshops around the country, his summer of flying has been more about sitting in airports than flying. He started sharing his experiences on his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kevinslimp); and received support and war stories from many other weary airline passengers.  
  
Should be fun. The show is on the same station, but it has a new home at 98.7. It's also streamed on the Internet.
