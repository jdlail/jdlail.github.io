White nationalist Hal Turner, who has found more to hate in this life than nearly everybody, has this message posted on his show's Web site about going to a subscription site on Nov. 28:  
    .  

> **Hundreds "kicked to the curb" as Hal Turner Show goes Subscription only**  
>
> For the first time, the internet version of my weekly radio show aired on a subscription-only basis. The traditional LISTEN LIVE links on my site stayed live for only the first 15 minutes of the program and will do so each week.  
>
> At 15 minutes past the hour, the free feed was shut off and only the subscription feed continued to carry the show on the internet. Protected by an authentication system requiring user names and passwords, not a single non-subscriber was able to tap into the feed. Only those who carried their own weight could tune in.  
>
> Many said I wouldn't dare drop 90% of my audience. Tonight I did exactly that.  
>
> It wasn't bad, either. Still had lots of callers throughout the two hours.  
>
> The best part is, the 90% of the audience who leeched and freeloaded, who contributed nothing to the show, got exactly what they deserved: nothing.  
>
> Tonight, the Hal Turner Show became an environment for the successful; for the achievers; the winners among us. In one, brief, shining moment, I separated the wheat from the chaff and embraced those who not only are committed to our cause, but who have the means to back-up their commitment.  
>
> No more will we be burdened by those whose failures in life are so complete, they can't afford $5 a month.  
>
> I'm considering a new slogan: "The Hal Turner Show, losers and poor white trash need not tune in!"  
>

A service for the discriminating listener, no doubt.
