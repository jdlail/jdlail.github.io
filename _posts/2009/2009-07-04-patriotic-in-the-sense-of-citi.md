[![Flag at Purple Pony in Chincoteauge.](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2670/3674459449_7d16162cdf.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/3674459449/ "Flag at Purple Pony in Chincoteauge.") It looks very patriotic on the week of the Fourth of July, but I think it covered up a disputed sign on the side of the building of the [Purple Pony](https://www.purplepony.com/pages/his.html).  
  
(And because it's the Fourth, some [fireworks photos](https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=fireworks&m=tags&ss=0&ct=0&w=96661011%40N00&adv=1) from a couple years ago.)
