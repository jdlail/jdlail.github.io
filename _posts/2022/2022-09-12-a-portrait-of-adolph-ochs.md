The East Tennessee Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists is holding [three events in September about Adolph Ochs'](https://etspj.org/three-september-events-to-honor-knoxville-journalism-history/) early years, when he lived in Knoxville. The last event will dedicate a historical plaque about [Ochs](https://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/ochs.pdf) on Market Square

I dug out these photos from my photo archive:

* A photo of his portrait in the [National Portrait Gallery](https://npg.si.edu/home/national-portrait-gallery)
* The caption text next to the painting

Please consider attending one or all of the ETSPJ events this month!
