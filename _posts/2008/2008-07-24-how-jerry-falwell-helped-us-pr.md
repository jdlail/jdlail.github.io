Just remember, it was [the Rev. Jerry Falwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Falwell) and Hustler's [Larry Flynt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Flynt) who clarified this issue of First Amendment law. This is a video with Gregory Galant, publisher and CEO of News Groper, that appeared on [Uncensored Interview](https://www.uncensoredinterview.com/vlogs/6795-UI-Experts-Greg-Galant-Hustler-Magazine-Saves-The-Day).  
  
[News Groper](https://www.newsgroper.com/) is a parody site of fake blogs of famous people. where, for example, a fake Samuel L. Jackson blog has a headline of "'The Dark Knight' needs more dark meat" and a fake Courtney Love says " Very good scientists! A sturdy erection makes women happy. Thanks for the update!"  
  
I wonder if they have heard about this in [Oklahoma](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080717/2000201718.shtml)?
