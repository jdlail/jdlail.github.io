Seattle-based journalist [Sanjay Bhatt](https://www.linkedin.com/ppl/webprofile?action=vmi&id=3699565&authToken=cXln&authType=name&trk=ppro_viewmore&lnk=vw_pprofile) has created "[The Ink-Stained Wretches Club](https://bleedingink.ning.com/)," a Ning group, according to the [Fitz and Jen blog](https://www.fitzandjen.com/2008/12/hi-im-a-newspap.html) on the Editor & Publisher Web site.  
  
Being an ink-stained wretch, I joined up. But that got me wondering who coined the commonly-used phrase "ink-stained wretch?" A [cursory walk through Google](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=origin+of+the+phrase+ink-stained+wretch&start=40&sa=N) turned up no definitive answer. But I did find where one person made [a stab at it](https://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/56/messages/712.html).  
  
Any of you "ink-stained wretches" know the history of that one?
