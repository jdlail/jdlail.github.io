A couple of quotes from a Washington Post [story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/28/AR2007122800693.html):  
  
> The [recording] industry maintains that it is illegal for someone who has legally purchased a CD to transfer that music into his computer.  
>
> Copying a song you bought is "a nice way of saying 'steals just one copy,'"  
>

So ripping a CD you bought to put it on your iPod is illegal, the music industry's attorneys maintain.  
  
That's taking a logical law to its illogical end.  
  
Preposterous? Ask a few formerly naive [University of Tennessee students](https://www.knoxnews.com/search/?q=riaa&sortby=date&sources=site) about the recording industry's ball peen hammer tactics.
