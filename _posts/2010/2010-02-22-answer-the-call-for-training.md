![John Seigenthaler Center](/images/3239848068_3822cf43ef.webp)For the last couple of months, I have been helping plan a workshop that will be held April 9 at the Freedom Forum's [John Seigenthaler Center](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1207+18th+Ave.+S.,+Nashville,+tn+27212&sll=35.870526,-84.057614&sspn=0.007286,0.018883&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1207+18th+Ave+S,+Nashville,+Davidson,+Tennessee+37212&z=16) in Nashville (pictured above).  
  
[![online  news association](/images/ONA_logo_022210.webp)](https://www.journalists.org/)A joint effort by the [Online News Association](https://www.journalists.org/) and the [Freedom Forum](https://www.freedomforum.org/), it is called "_Smart Phones for Smart Journalists_."  
  
It's extremely affordable training at $35 per person ($25 for Online News Association members and for alumni of the Freedom Forum's Diversity Institute). You can see the schedule for the day and register at the [Online News Association's site](https://journalists.org/events/event_details.asp?id=96897).  
  
The affordable registration cost was made possible in part through support from the [Scripps Howard Foundation](https://www.scripps.com/foundation) and Nashville-based [Cell Journalist Inc.](https://www.celljournalistinc.com/), a photo and video platform used by more than 60 media outlets nationwide.  
  
Here's a look at the speakers, a lineup I'm extremely excited about. I hope you can join us in Nashville in April. If you have questions, drop me an [e-mail](mailto:contact@goldenleaf.addy.io?subject=ONA%20Nashville).  
  
![Bill Tallent](/images/TallentPhotoHeadShot.webp)**Bill Tallent, CEO of Mercury Intermedia, Brentwood, Tenn.**  
  
Tallent is CEO of Mercury Intermedia, a firm that develops native mobile applications for some of the nation's top news-related companies. The insights gained should be of interest to all attendees.  
  
Tallent has worked in technology since he helped start the first computer class in his senior year at Western Kentucky State University in 1963.  He worked in technology at Genesco, Inc. for 20 years and started a new tailored apparel division.  Bit by the "start-up" bug, he has spent the last 25 years starting, operating, and selling small businesses.  
  
He sees the iPhone and Android phones as fourth generation computers that will expand computer usage dramatically given that they are truly personal and carried by the owner 16-18 hours per day.  
  
![Rob King](/images/20070618_KingRob1_RA.webp)**Rob King, Vice President and Editor In Chief, ESPN Digital Media**  
   
Rob King was named Editor In Chief of ESPN Digital Media in September 2009. In the role, he is responsible for supervision of all content and the overall editorial direction for the leading portfolio of digital sports properties, including all text, audio, video and multimedia content.  He also oversees the management of the award-winning team of more than 200 editors, writers and designers across ESPN.com and its network of related sites.  He reports directly to John Kosner, senior vice president and general manager, ESPN Digital Media.  King had previously served as vice president and Editor In Chief of ESPN.com since June 2007, adding oversight of digital video and audio content as well as all editorial content on ESPN's local sites in 2009.  
  
King works closely with ESPN's many news, information, content and programming units under Norby Williamson, executive vice president, programming, to develop greater cross- platform integration and development of cross-media franchises.  
  
King brings extensive experience and sound news and editorial judgment to the job. Since 2004 he served as a senior coordinating producer in the studio production unit, responsible for (at various times): ESPN's award-winning NBA studio programming; the award-winning Outside the Lines; ESPN's on-location coverage of major golf events, including the Masters and the U.S. Open; and ESPNEWS, the nation's only 24-hour sports news television network.  
  
King began his career in the newspaper business.  From 1997 - 2004, he was at the Philadelphia Inquirer, serving as graphic artist, deputy sports editor, assistant managing editor and deputy managing editor.  Prior to that, King worked at the Louisville Courier-Journal as a graphic artist, director of photography and presentation editor.  From 1987 through 1992, he worked at the Courier-Post in Cherry Hill, N.J., a major suburban Philadelphia paper.  His first job was with the Commercial-News in Danville, Ill., as a general assignment reporter and graphic artist.  
  
King received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Wesleyan University in 1984.
