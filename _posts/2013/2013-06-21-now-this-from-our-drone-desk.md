Which news organization will be the first to have a "drone desk?"

The photo above was taken not by a journalist, but by a drone hobbyist in 2012 who believed a Texas meat packing plant was dumping blood into a river. He [turned his photos over to state authorities](https://www.suasnews.com/2012/01/11389/dallas-meat-packing-plant-investigated-after-drone-images-reveal-pollution/), sparking an investigation.

> "These drones are increasingly sophisticated and may be used in cases where flying a helicopter would pose a safety threat for the pilot. For newsrooms figuring out how to pay for a helicopter, fuel and a pilot, the drones -- which can cost from $500 to a few thousand dollars, may be the way of the future."

\-- Mark Tremayne, assistant professor of broadcast communication at the University of Texas Arlington.

Tremayne was part of a University of Texas at Arlington communication team that studied some recent private drone use cases.

[There are lot of issues with private use of drones](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130618102003.htm) in the United States, but as the price of the devices drops, it's inevitable that they will be used; if not in the pursuit of journalism, certainly in many other fields for applications we haven't even thought of.
