![Cafe Shop Tip Jar](/images/2186958444_1e102d1d50.webp)Stewart Brand [recaps](https://blog.longnow.org/2008/01/14/paul-saffo-embracing-uncertainty-the-secret-to-effective-forecasting/) a talk by futurist Paul Saffo, a Stanford University professor who has spent more than 20 years looking at technological change and it practical impacts. Saffe spoke at a Jan. 11, 2008, seminar put on by The Long Now Foundation.  
  
He outlined eight rules for forecasting the future. But what I liked was his closer. He had a photograph from a San Francisco cafe that had this tapped to a tip jar beside the cash register: "If you fear change leave it in here."  
  
Saffo's eight rules of effective forecasting:  
  
Rule: Wild cards sensitize us to surprise.  
  
Rule: Change is never linear.  
  
Rule: Look for indicators- things that don't fit.  
  
Rule: Look back twice as far.  
  
Rule: Cherish failure. Preferably other people's.  
  
Rule: Be indifferent.  
  
Rule: Assume you are wrong. And forecast often.  
  
Rule: Embrace uncertainty.  
  
([Steward Brand](https://sb.longnow.org/Home.html): Remember him ... among his many firsts is this one I spotted in his bio and hadn't heard before: first use of the term "personal computer" in a book, 1974. Seriously ahead of his time for decades!)
