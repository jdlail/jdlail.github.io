Howard Owens tells about his [personal experiences](https://www.howardowens.com/2007/craigslist-vs-the-bakersfield-californian/) using Craigslist and the local paper to sell his house. His experience somewhat mirrors what [Classified Intelligence](https://www.classifiedintell.com/?id=classifiedintelligencereport&PHPSESSID=9575be9149801c7b3e3d2752c4a66c5f) found in its January 2007 report on Craigslist and newspapers (via subscription only I believe). During Classified Intelligence's 18-month study, 12 new Craigslist communities were studied. The bottomline of the study was that newspapers can effectively combat Craigslist -- if they aggressively go after the business. Howard Owens' assessment:

> For all of the buzz around craigslist, it isn’t the category killer some pretend it is, nor is Monster, nor any of the dot com auto or real estate verticals.
