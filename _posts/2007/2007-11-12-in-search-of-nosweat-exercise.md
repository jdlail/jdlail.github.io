Got back to the right number of sessions, but not enough miles or time. Some improvement, however.

Hmmm .... I do know where the Halloween candy went.

Tim Ferriss of the [four-hour workweek fame](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/fashion/11guru.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=13eb620d272c2303&ex=1352437200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss), has a blog posting on an exercise regimen called "[I Gained 34lbs. of Muscle in 4 Weeks](https://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/04/29/from-geek-to-freak-how-i-gained-34-lbs-of-muscle-in-4-weeks/)" and one on dieting called "[How to Lose 20 lbs. of Fat in 30 Days… Without Doing Any Exercise](https://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise/)".

The guy's hype is certainly something. He solves everything from junk info to junk food.

Recent postings on [his blog](https://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/):

* How to Learn (But Not Master) Any Language in 1 Hour (Plus: A Favor)
* Embracing Ignorance as Advantage—a Case Study (Plus: Speaking Nov. 5th and 10th)
* How I Prostitute Myself (and Other Options for You)
* The Art of Letting Bad Things Happen (and Weapons of Mass Distraction)
* What Happens When an Agnostic Follows the Bible Literally for One Year?

Stowe Boyd says at least as far the four-hour workweek, he's just bunk in "[Cult Of Productivity: We Know He's Lying, But Who Cares?](https://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/11/cult-of-fluff-w.html)"

You got any thoughts on Ferriss and his miracle, no-sweat recommendations?
