The [Digg Revolt](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=%22digg+surrenders%22+and+digg+revolt) is fascinating: It's [stage-setting](https://onlinemediacultist.com/2007/05/02/digg-and-the-complications-of-the-social-news-model/).

Revolts are good for [traffic](https://www.venturevoice.com/2007/05/good_angry_customers_and_the_d.html). It's not the mob that's the problem, it's [anonymous individuals](https://publishing2.com/2007/05/02/the-problem-with-digg-is-anonymous-users/). It's much [bigger than we realize](https://www.thepomoblog.com/archive/modernisms-problem-with-social-media/).
