[![The Duhks](/images/duhksphoto-thumb.webp)](/images/duhksphoto.webp) I guess I'm a latecomer to the Duhks. I bought the band's latest album [Migrations](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=the%20duhks&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&index=music&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=ur2&o=1)" over the weekend and am enjoying it. Best of luck in your Grammy nomination for "Best Country Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal" for "Heaven's My Hom," which is on the Migrations release. Produced by Tom O'Brien. Can't go wrong there. _Nice tunes!_ And ... WNCW has posted their listeners [Top 100](https://www.wncw.org/Top100.html). Also includes top regional, top blues, top reggae, top bluegrass and top celtic. Great list to scan for new tunes.
