Social media [has evolved](https://www.igreenbaum.com/2008/05/when-a-readers-restaurant-review-gets-the-cops-involved/) to the days when angry story subjects showed up at newspapers to take a swing at the editor. That's actually happened once since I've been at the News Sentinel, but that's a tale for another day..  
  
Of course, the tactic may not be [all that successful](https://www.yelp.com/biz/beso-st-louis).  
  
Revised headline: Give this post blog post 5 stars, pretty please.
