As one who spends an ever expanding amount of time dealing with such creatures, I found Shane Richmond [piece on trolls](https://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/feb08/why-online-communities-attract-trolls.htm) an excellent read and with a pointer to another nice read by [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/trolls.html).  
  
Finding a balance between robust and vibrant and civil and polite takes a lot of effort.
