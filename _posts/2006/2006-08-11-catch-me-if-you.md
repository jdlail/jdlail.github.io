![State Your Case hosted by George Korda](https://www.wnoxnewstalk.com/_data/images/stateyourcase200.webp) I'll be on the radio show "State Your Case," hosted by George Korda, on FM 100 [WNOX](https://www.wnoxnewstalk.com/index.idc) at noon on Sunday (Aug. 13) talking about [Knoxnews](https://www.knoxnews.com/). Tune in if you can. The station does stream its shows on the Internet so I'm guessing this one is available both on-air and on the net. Never been on the radio with Korda so it should be an adventure in radioland. I have no clue as to what kind of questions callers might have. The show is on from 12 to 3 p.m. -- three hours!
