I liked this thought Forbes publisher Rich Karlgaard pointed out in a column last week.

> "Picturing a single match is a reminder of the finite nature of your marketing resources," Stielstra writes. "No matter what they are--money, people or time--you only have so much. Opportunity costs are critical. How will you use your match?

Stielstra is Greg Stielstra, who has a new book, PyroMarketing (HarperBusiness, $21.95). He suggests thinking about using your marketing resources as if you had but one match to start a fire. ... Kind of interesting way at looking at a lot of things. His suggestions:

* Gather the driest tinder.
* Touch it with the match.
* Fan the flames.
* Save the coals.
Read Rich's column [here](https://www.forbes.com/columnists/columnists/global/2006/0424/014.html). I may read the book!
