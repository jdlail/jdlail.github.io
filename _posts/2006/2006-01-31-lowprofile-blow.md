That bux-maddened [Mock Tech](https://www.mocktech.com/geek/article.php?story=20060131115656353) has blown my low-profile cover with a photo. He caught me, of course, in the midst of a dangerous mission.

It was the New Media assimilation of a self-described "Vice President of Old Media" from New Mexico. He, and his entourge, were subjected to hours of acronym torture in the Scripps' New Media command center, which is cleverly disguised as "Talbots" and nestled behind behind a McDonald's. Simply diabotical in its innocuous appearance!
