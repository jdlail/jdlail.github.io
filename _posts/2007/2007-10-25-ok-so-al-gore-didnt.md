[![Al and Tipper Gore, AP Photo](/images/1025alandtipper-thumb-150x101.webp)](/images/1025alandtipper.webp)OK, so Al Gore didn't invent the Internet (single-handily), but he did make global warming a movie and he has now [re-defined TV](https://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/al_gore_current_re-defining_television.php). And TIpper cleaned up the record industry. That dynamite group gave the prize to the wrong couple; It should have been Al and Tipper, not Al and the UN.  
  
> What I like about Current, apart from the awesome design, is that they're attempting to change the way television is consumed _and created_. It's a much more interactive experience, where the audience participates and creates.

Gore's Current, to use a bit more brevity than MacManus, is pretty cool. I posted a [RandomThis video](https://current.com/items/85572551_katie_gets_all_touristy_in_atlanta) on it over the weekend.
