[Mark Cuban](https://www.blogmaverick.com/2008/05/04/the-ala-carting-of-video-on-the-net-will-it-lead-to-disaster/) quoting (I think) Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research:  
  
> Ironically, we are headed down the same self-destructive road for other kinds of traditional media,as well. Five years into the video-over-the-Internet revolution, we have learned two things.
