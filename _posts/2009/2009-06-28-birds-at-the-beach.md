These photos were shot at dusk from the porch of the condo where we're staying in Chincoteague Island, Va. On a nearby pier is a bar where a guy is playing guitar and singing Steve Miler's "The Joker."  
  
Cause I'm a picker  
I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover  
And I'm a sinner  
I play my music in the sun.  
I'm a joker  
I'm a smoker  
I'm a midnight toker  
I get my loving on the run Wooo Woooo
