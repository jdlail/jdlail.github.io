The Net buzz is about Google Buzz, which launched this week. It's an important product, another turning point in the development of Social Media, no doubt. But it's a week in which we were also reminded that game-changing ideas aren't the sole province of big companies with legions of brillantly smart people.  
  
[The New York Times](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/13/chatroulettes-founder-17-introduces-himself/) discovered that [Chatroulette](https://www.chatroulette.com/), a site that connects you randomly to a Webcam user and has rapidly grown in popularity worldwide (often hosting 20,000 users at time at night) was developed by a 17-year-old ... in Moscow.  
  
Surprised?  

> _I created this project for fun. Initially, I had no business goals with it. I created this project recently. I was and still am a teenager myself, that is why I had a certain feeling of what other teenagers would want to see on the Internet. I myself enjoyed talking to friends with Skype using a microphone and webcam. But we got tired of talking to each other eventually. So I decided to create a little site for me and my friends where we could connect randomly with other people._

I'm still not sure if this is something we should invest it, but I'd sure like to meet this guy.")
