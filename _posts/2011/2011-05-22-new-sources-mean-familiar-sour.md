New survey out on how journalists use Twitter, Facebook and social networks.  
  
> But conventional PR sources far outweighed the use of social media for story ideas, with 62 per cent of journalists sourcing stories from PR agences and 59 per cent from corporate spokespersons.  
>
> Journalists seemed more reluctant to turn to social media to help them with stories they were already working on. The survey found that only a third used Twitter to verify stories and just a quarter turned to Facebook.
