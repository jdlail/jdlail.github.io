![Ad Age: Media Industry Jobs](/images/datacenter092908_02.webp)In the latest Advertising Age magazine [Media 100](https://adage.com/datacenter/datapopup.php?article_id=131295), released on Monday, the structural changes in media become apparent.  
  
As a media, newspapers ranked fourth, accounting for 10.4 percent of media revenue. Two decades ago, its slice of the pie was 35.9 percent.  
  
There are winners, however, as well as losers: Digital, revenue, up 10.8 percent; cable-networks, up 10.6 percent; newspapers, down 6.8 percent. Newspaper revenue dropped $2.3 billion. Google's gain wasn't that far behind newspaper's loss at $1.9 billion.  
  
And, oh yes, the Media 100 is trailing information. It's based on 2007 revenues. In the newspaper industry, at least, 2007 looks in hindsight to be a summer walk in the park with a rain shower compared to a brutal wintry 2008.

And if you look at the [changing job picture](https://adage.com/datacenter/article?article_id=131302) from 2002 and last year, it's hard to argue against her point.  
  
Here's how some of the media companies with significant presence in Knoxville rank: 2nd, (same as the year before) Comcast; 14th, (down from 12th) Gannett (WBIR); 16th, (down from 15th) Charter Communications; 34th, (first year) Scripps Networks; 41st, (up from 42nd) Lamar Advertising (billboards);  47th, (down from 43rd) E.W. Scripps (KNS Media Group, including the Knoxville News Sentinel); 48th, (down from 46th) Citadel Broadcasting Corp. (radio stations), and 75th (down from 66th) Journal Communications (radio stations here).
