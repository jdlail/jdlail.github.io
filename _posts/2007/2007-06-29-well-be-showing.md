[![George Korda's State Your Case](/images/stateyourcase200062907-thumb.webp)](/images/stateyourcase200062907.webp)I'll be on George Korda's "State Your Case" radio show on Sunday (July 1) at noon, [NewsTalk 100](https://www.wnoxnewstalk.com/weekendprograms.idc?url=weekendprograms.idc), talking about and answering questions on the redesign of [knoxnews.com](https://www.knoxnews.com/), a free [GoVolsXtra.com](https://www.govolsxtra.com/) and whatever else. Tune in. I'm sure I'm not exciting enough for the whole three hours (it's on from noon to 3), but maybe we'll have enough to talk about for the first hour.
