The departure of [Jim O'Shea](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=%22jim+o%27shea%22&btnG=Search+Blogs) from the L.A. Times shouldn't be construed as fighting the gallant battle for journalism. It was the battle for status quo and business as usual.  
  
What's needed is creative thinking, new approaches and a reassessment of what newspapers do. O'Shea failed on all points. He needed to go.  
  
Pulling last year's or four year's ago plans from the files and adjusting for inflation is not managing as an editor. Finding a way to do great journalism (big J and little J) despite the obstacles is.
