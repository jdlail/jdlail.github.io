Gannett Corp. and the New York Times have rolled out changes to comments on their web sites. Gannett, which had been piloting using Facebook comments (a Facebook account is required to comment), is switching all newspaper.com sites to it. The New York Times unveiled a "trusted commenter" system.  
  
Both moves show media companies are still trying to find the right "voice" for their web site users. The dilemma is whether "read names" will not only "clean up" hateful comments, but also turn community conversation elsewhere.
