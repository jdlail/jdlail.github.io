These [two items](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/roll/2010/04/knoxnewscom-documentary-video-1.html), a plan by a Missouri Corrections Department worker to use a knoxnews video as part of a training program and the fact that the same video won the newspaper its first regional Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA), have brightened the week!  
  
The video "[Death on Chipman Street](https://www.knoxnews.com/videos/detail/chipman-murders-channon-christian-chris-newsom)' is damn good journalism from a damn good group of online producers.
