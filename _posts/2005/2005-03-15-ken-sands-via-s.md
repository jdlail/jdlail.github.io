Online Publisher Ken Sands in Spokane has good good points in this [Online News](https://talk.poynter.org/online-news/) post that the indefatigable Susan Mernit posted to her [blog](https://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2005/03/ken-sands-doing-online-news-another.html).

> "If you think about it, posting a newspaper online is giving people a snapshot of yesterday's news. We should instead, give them today's news and a bit of tomorrow's news, as well as making full use of the unique attributes of the web, including: immediacy, interactivity, utility, multimedia, entertainment, archiving, aggregation and community publishing."
