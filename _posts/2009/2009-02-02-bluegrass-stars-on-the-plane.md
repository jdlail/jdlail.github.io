[![Dan Tyminski](/assets_c/2009/02/IMG_0108-thumb-150x200-426.webp)](/images/IMG_0108.webp)Being a bluegrass fan, it dawned on me that the guy sitting behind me on a flight Monday from New York to Nashville was bluegrass star [Dan Tyminski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Tyminski). Never heard of him? He's been a member of Alison Krauss and Union Station since 1994 and the winner of 10 Grammy awards. See more on his [Web site](https://www.dantyminski.com/bios_Dan.html).  
  
Turns out he was returning from a couple of shows in Scotland and was excited about heading to L.A. in the next few days for the [Grammys](https://twitter.com/thegrammys/) and some golf.  
  
He's up for a Grammy for his [Wheels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019A1SGK?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0019A1SGK)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0019A1SGK) release. _Best of luck!_  
  
[![Jerry Douglas](/assets_c/2009/02/IMG_0110-thumb-150x159-428.webp)](/images/IMG_0110.webp) Once I got off the plane, I realized that Dobro player extraordinaire [Jerry Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Douglas_%28musician%29) was also on board. Douglas has played on more than 1,600 albums. I have no idea how he's done that. See his [Web site](https://www.jerrydouglas.com/).  
  
Now that's flying.
