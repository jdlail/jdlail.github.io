[![Arenal Volcano](/assets-c/2008/10/arenal-volcano-4-thumb-150x99.webp)](/images/arenal-volcano-4.webp)The [Innovator's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology) for newspapers is that while they must radically adapt to the changing media landscape and the economic realities of an economic downturn, a sizable number of loyal print readers aren't ready to turn the page with them.  
  
In a [snarky blog post](https://blogs.tampabay.com/media/2008/10/amid-a-deluge-o.html) at the Tampa Tribune's cross bay rival tampabay.com, TV/media critic Eric Deggans wrote:

Listen to someone passionate about their printed newspaper like Dr. Kathy Hansen, writing on her "[A Storied Career](https://astoriedcareer.com/2008/10/storytelling-and-the-death-of.html)" blog:  
  
> The newspaper I have read for the last 16 years, the Orlando Sentinel, has undergone a number of cost-cutting ravagings of its size and scope, all in the guise of "re-designs" that purport to make the paper better. Of course, they do not. They reduce it to a shadow of its former self.

The problem is print readership is both declining and growing older (not an encouraging sign for future growth). Expect the volcanic activity to continue ...
