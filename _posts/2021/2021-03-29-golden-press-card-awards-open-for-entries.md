Get you best work of 2020 recognized by entering the East Tennessee Society of Professional Journalists [Golden Press Card Awards](https://betternewspapercontest.com/2020-etspj).

The challenges of last year meant journalists played an even larger role in informing the public with timely, accurate and trustworthy information. Despite the obstacles of working remotely and pandemic safety guidelines, East Tennessee journalists increased efforts to keep the public informed. A lot of great work was done and it should be highlighted.

If you are an East Tennessee journalist, I encourage you to enter the Golden Press Card Awards today. [The chapter](https://etspj.org/) is using a new system so get started so you don't run into any last minute issues.

The deadline for entries is April 20.
