> ![Ruffin McNeill](/images/012210ruffinmcneill.webp)GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Ruffin McNeill didn't say a word. He just walked into the room filled with reporters and fans waiting to hear from East Carolina's new coach and repeatedly pumped his right fist in the air.

> He was home, back at his alma mater and in his native North Carolina.

> "This is my destination job," McNeill said Friday. "Let's get that out front right now. This is not a stepping-stone hop for Ruff. This is where I want to be until you tow me away from here. You'll have to drag me away."

A great way to start. McNeill sounds like he'll do great at East Carolina and I wish him well. Amid the slew of  crazy college coach stories of the last few weeks, this is a positive one. Everything I have read about McNeill praises him as a person.
