I'm joining the crowd rushing out the door at X. I will no longer post at the freak show, but I plan to keep my seat to lurk until the sports accounts I follow find the exit sign.

I'm now learning how to get the most out of Blue Sky and Threads. I'll probably settle on just one of those eventually.

Find me at:

* @jacklail.bsky.social on[Blue Sky](https://bsky.app/)
* @jacklail on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/?hl=en)

While those two are my X replacements, I'm still on LinkedIn and Facebook. I mostly lurk at Instagram.

I have been on Twitter (now X) for [a long time](https://jacklail.com/2009/05/just-for-the-record/).

But it's changed ...
