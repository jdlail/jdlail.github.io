I'm doing a Webinar today on online legal issues, another in a series E.W. Scripps is doing with journalism professors at Hampton University using [Skype](https://www.skype.com/) and [DimDim](https://www.dimdim.com/). These are some interesting conversations.  
  
I've put together a set of links for them and I thought others might find the list useful. An earlier set of links dealt with [ethics](/2009/11/ethics-in-journalisms-digital-.html).
