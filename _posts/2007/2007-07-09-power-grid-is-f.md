It's amazing that with all the high tech mumbo jumbo and fail-safe systems we have available in modern society that a bird on a suicidal swoop at a substation can hold the newspaper and 4,299 other customers powerless.

> An errant bird caused a 30-minute power outage this afternoon for 4,300 Knoxville Utilities Board customers when it flew into a substation.

We [reported that](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/jul/09/errant-bird-causes-fowl-problems-kub/) Monday online after the lights came back on. Tags: [power failure](https://technorati.com/tag/power failure)
