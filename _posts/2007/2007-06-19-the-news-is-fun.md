[This](https://www.lostremote.com/2007/06/17/daily-show-and-colbert-viewers-most-informed-about-news/) is just funnier than Jon Stewart, but at least it means my kids are on top of the news. The people most knowledgeable about news events, according to a new Pew study, are:

> ... those who got their news from the Web sites of major papers and those who watched programs like The Colbert Report or The Daily Show; they correctly answered 54 percent of the questions about current affairs, while regular viewers of local TV news and network morning shows got only about 35 percent right.

I'm sure it's the newspaper Web sites, right? Well, [yes](https://www.editorsweblog.org/news/2007/06/harris_survey_readers_prefer_online_to_p.php).
