I know the Apple fanboys will pout; those that rave about [the Apple packaging experience](https://smorgasbord-design.blogspot.com/2007/10/regular-readers-if-there-are-any-left.html), but I call a 40-page manual in a box of iPod earphones _excessive_. Count' em.  
  
The short version: Put the pointy end in your iPod and the other two ends in your ears. Listen!  
  
Not even 40 words!
