John Seigenthaler of the Freedom Forum speaking at "The Mobile Migration Workshop" on April 1, 2011 at the John Seigenthaler Center in Nashville.  
  
Seigenthaler compared [Wikileaks](https://wikileaks.ch/ "WikiLeaks") to the [Pentagon Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers "Pentagon Papers"). It may be irresponsible, but irresponsible speech is protected by the First Amendment. However, he said responsibility in  communication is vital in protecting First Amendment in the "general spirit of the people."   
  
The workshop was co-sponsored by the [Online News Association](https://www.jouranlists.org/) and the [Freedom Forum Diversity Institute](https://freedomforumdiversity.org/).
