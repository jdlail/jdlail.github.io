I had requests for Christmas pictures. Well, to be truthful, I had one, but then the Newscoma started [this](https://newscoma.wordpress.com/2007/12/16/the-dont-taze-me-bro-christmas-meme/) with a [double-dog dare](https://twitter.com/newscoma/statuses/506041802).  
  
So a double-dog combo to go, photos and a blog [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme).  
  
Rules for the game include:  
  
  1. Link to the person that tagged you, and post the rules on your blog.
  2. Share Christmas facts about yourself.
  3. Tag 7 random people at the end of your post, and include links to their blogs.
  4. Let each person know that they have been tagged by leaving a comment on their blog.

Welcome to the Christmas edition of getting to know your friends.  
  
**1\. Wrapping or gift bags?** First, which did you get?  
  
[![DSC_0010.JPG](/images/DSC_0010-thumb-150x311.webp)](/images/DSC_0010.webp)**2\. Real or artificial tree**? Tree. Singular? There are least eight up, not sure that is the extent of the Yuletide mayhem. [See the slide show](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/sets/72157603470325786/show/)  
  
**3\. When do you put up the tree?** Key word there is you.  
  
**4\. When do you take the tree down?** Another questions with aforementioned key word.  
  
**5\. Do you like eggnog?** Yes, Weigels or Mayfield's. Usually without spirits.  
  
**6\. Favorite gift received as a child?** All were welcomed.  
  
**7\. Do you have a nativity scene?** [Yes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/2114762611/).  
  
**8\. Worst Christmas gift you ever received?** I better at buying things I don't like for myself.  
  
**9\. Mail or email Christmas cards?** I like mailing cards. To hell with tree saving.  
  
**10\. Favorite Christmas Movie?** Yeah, I'm going to go with Coma's "It’s a Wonderful Life"  
  
**11\. When do you start shopping for Christmas?** Thanksgiving week is the official start of the Christmas buying. Anything earlier is to buy into Christmas sales in August. Wonder why Amazon has thought of "locking in" gifts a year early?  
  
**12\. Favorite thing to eat at Christmas?** Cookies and cookies.  
  
**13\. Clear lights or colored on the tree?** I like white lights, no tinsel.  
  
**14\. Favorite Christmas song?** Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town by the Boss the E Street Band. Also, John Prine's Christmas in Prison.

**15\. Travel at Christmas or stay home?** We always stay home for Christmas Eve and hit the family trail the day after Christmas.  
  
**16\. Can you name all of Santa’s reindeer?** Yes, with the help of the Internets.  
  
**17\. Angel on the tree top or a star?** Both, with as many trees as we have, all options are available.  
  
**18\. Open the presents Christmas Eve or Christmas Morning?** Both and the day after Christmas.  
  
**19\. Most annoying thing about this time of year?** Traffic.  
  
**20\. Do you decorate your tree in any specific theme or color?** Hmmm... a variation of you. We have theemed and unthemed.  
  
**21\. What do you leave for Santa?** Cookies and milk, of course.  
  
**22\. Least favorite holiday song?** Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer.  
  
**23\. Favorite ornament?** We have a large collection of Westmoore Pottery [Christmas ornaments](https://www.westmoorepottery.com/ornaments.htm). I've often given them as gifts as well.
