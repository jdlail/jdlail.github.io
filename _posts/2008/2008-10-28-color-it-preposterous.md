The "Financial Crisis" version of  "[Blame the Journalists](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2008/09/journos_former.shtml)."  
_

> _I believe a former investigative reporter for Atlanta's daily newspaper likely pitched the snowball that grew into the avalanche and buried our leading mortgage institutions._

That's the "blame the journalists" premise from journalist [Mike Masterson](https://www.nwanews.com/adg/Editorial/238182/) in a column last week in the Arkansas Gazette Democrat.  
  
Not Freddie, Fannie, lobbyists, Wall Street, financial policy, lax regulation, greed, banks, savings and loans, Congress, the Fed, knaves nor world credit markets, Just a reporter in Atlanta looking at home loan practices in neighborhoods beck in 1998 in a series called "The Color of Money."  
  
_Ah, sure._  
  
A [response from Bill Dedman](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2008/09/journos_former.shtml#c3689050), who wrote the series that won him a Pulitzer Prize.
