Which Tennessee men's basketball team will be in the Final Four and play for the championship?  
  
One educated guess is Belmont.  
  
Inside Higher Ed did a NCAA men's basketball bracket based the NCAA's Academic Progress Rate with the NCAA's Graduation Success Rate as the tiebreaker.  
  
See the full details [on this methodology](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/03/17/bracket), which is not recommended for those with hopes of winning the office pool.  
  
In this bracket, No. 2 seed Tennessee doesn't make it out of the first round and No. 1 seed Memphis exits in the second round. But that B-ball team from Belmont makes it to a final game against brainy Davidson, where its Cinderella run ends.
