More Joe Friday than Lilly Rush, upper East Tennessee police departments have gone YouTube.  
  
The Kingsport Police Department has joined [a growing number of police departments](https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2007-03-04-you-tube-crime_N.htm) using YouTube to publicize cases. Kingsport is using [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdbJsrn8TQE) in hopes of getting leads in the 1994 murder of "[Miss Annie" Heath](https://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9004954), who was 67 when she was beaten to death in her apartment.  
  
The Johnson City Police Department is a doing a "[Dirty Dozen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zle2RXPCC_0)" list of bad guys it is looking for to a soundtrack of music from TV police shows like "Law and Order."  
  
Not a bad idea. The videos also go on local community access cable channels.
