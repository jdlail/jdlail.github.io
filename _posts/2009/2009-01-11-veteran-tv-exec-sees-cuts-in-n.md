Some predictions for 2009 from MIke Sechrist, a broadcast veteran and now entrepreneur.  
  
> I would not be surprised if the Tennessean cuts back on home delivery as a number of papers have already. I would not be surprised if one or two local TV stations cut back to one or two newscasts a day. And it would not surprise me at all if the FCC takes another look at 'convergence' letting one company own a newspaper and possibly multiple TV stations in one market.  
>

Sechrist predictions come in a column posted today on [NewsTechZilla](https://www.newstechzilla.com/2009/01/the-elephant-in-the-room-by-mike-sechrist/).  
  
He also has some advice.  
  
> Reporters and photographers both print and broadcast who are still employed or recently laid off would do well to invest in a digital camera and laptop with a good editing program and develop or refine their skills in shooting and editing. A skilled freelance video journalist will find themselves in demand in the coming years.

Sechrist will be at the Jan. 30 "[ONA Nashville: Journalism Has a Future, "Real things real journalists can do right now to embrace it](https://journalists.org/events/event_details.asp?id=33191)," at the Freedom Forum in Nashville. He will be on a panel on the "The Evolving Newsroom." Join us!
