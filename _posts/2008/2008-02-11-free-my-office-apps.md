Following up on my [mini-rant](/2008/02/new-for-the-reporters-tool-bel.html) Sunday about Microsoft Office, is the Microsoft-Yahoo deal really about [free software](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/technology/09free.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=zero+dollar+yahoo&st=nyt&oref=slogin), or to use the buzz phrase, "zero-dollar" software?

There's more than zero in the deal, I'm sure (lots of zeros, it seems), but even if sales haven't been affected yet, Web-based and open source alternatives like Open Office are clearly gaining momentum. And if you follow the presidential primaries, you know market perception is all about the Mo.

I don't think it'll be too long before corporations get comfy with using free software. When that happens, $300 MS Office licenses are a relic for the digital archeologists.

Nicholas Carr [has some thoughts](https://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/02/does_microsoft.php) far more insightful than mine.
