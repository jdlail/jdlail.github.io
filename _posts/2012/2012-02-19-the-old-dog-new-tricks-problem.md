A [great read for anyone worried about the newspaper business](https://jxpaton.wordpress.com/2012/02/18/old-dogs-new-tricks-and-crappy-newspaper-executives/) from John Paton, CEO of Digital First Media:  
  
> As career journalists we have entered a new era where what we know and what we traditionally do has finally found its value in the marketplace and that value is about zero.  
>
> Our traditional journalism models and our journalistic efforts are inefficient and up against the Crowd - armed with mobile devices and internet connections- incomplete.  
>
> Our response to date as an industry has been as equally inefficient and in many cases emotional.  
>
> "You're gonna miss us when we're gone" is not much of a business model.
