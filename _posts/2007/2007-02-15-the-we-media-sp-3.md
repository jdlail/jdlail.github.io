Now this was [different](https://www.ericlail.com/archives/2007/02/best_break_up_i.html). Not exactly Time's "We Media" couple of the year. It's interesting to see the power of an online social network as "news source" and the amount of "media" this event attracted. It's looks like life imitating the filming of a realty TV show about life. Watch the nine minute video, which had gotten 5,295 views in about a day. Decidedly viral.
