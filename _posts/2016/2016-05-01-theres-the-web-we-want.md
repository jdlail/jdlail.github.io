The Guardian is trying to bring "The Web Web Want" and the web we've got closer together in one of the most indepth looks at the [negative issues of online comments](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments) and [how to fix it](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/08/how-can-we-improve-the-guardian-comments-share-your-views) in a series called "[The Web We Want](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/the-web-we-want)."

The Guardian says it gets 50,000 comments a day, sometimes spiking up to 70,000 a day. It's asking readers for ideas on how to make online conversations -- or at least commenting -- better.

Below, NPR's Audie Cornish speaks with the Guardian's series editor Becky Gardiner and writer Nesrine Malik about the effort.
