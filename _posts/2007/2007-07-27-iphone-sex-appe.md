Here's two video views of the sex appeal (or social networking creds) of the oh-so-trendy iPhone. [iPhone of the Sexes](https://ilanadonna.typepad.com/downtown_diary/2007/07/iphone-of-the-s.html) from New York video blogger Ilana Arazie and [iPhone Lovin'](https://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1119166902?bclid=1078573088&bctid=1124878404) from the Wall Street Journal's Andy Jordan and his new [Tech Diary video blog](https://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid452319854/bctid1124878404). Gee, maybe iPhone owners will just have to use it as a phone/iPod/Internet device. Go figure.
