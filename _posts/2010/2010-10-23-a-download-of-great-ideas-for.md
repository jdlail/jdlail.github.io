[![2010 Great Ideas Book](/images/greatideas485.webp)](https://www.apme.com/?page=GreatIdeas)

One of the great projects of the Associated Press Managing Editors (APME) is the annual Great Ideas book. A PDF of  the 2010 edition, as well as the 2007, 2008 and 2009 editions, [has been posted](https://www.apme.com/?page=GreatIdeas) on the APME website.  
  
Kurt Franck, executive editor of The (Toledo) Blade, and Terry Orme, managing editor at The Salt Lake Tribune, make this happen.
