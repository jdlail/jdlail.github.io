I took a tour of Greenspun Interactive on Tuesday afternoon, the home of Web sites for the [Las Vegas Sun](https://www.lasvegassun.com/) and [Las Vegas Weekly](https://www.lasvegasweekly.com/) and discovered what might be a tell for the success (hey I'm in Vegas) of president and executive editor Rob Curley.

There were several clocks on the wall in true world news fashion of distant cities, but these were all cities covered by the Greenspun Web crew around Las Vegas so they all had the same time except "Curley Standard Time."

Watch for a lot of exciting developments to come out of there -- soon.
