The news about newspapers is so bad that now the industry looks like the fish wrapper for what not to do. Pat Coyle, director of Database Marketing & E Commerce for the Indianapolis Colts, [suggests](https://www.patcoyle.net/2006/12/01/what-can-nfl-learn-from-the-newspaper-business/) the NFL learn from the lessons taught to newspapers rather than taking that course itself.

> While they were #1, they coulda woulda shoulda been re-inventing themselves to compete in the new media landscape. Likewise, I think the NFL teams could benefit from aggregating our on-line audiences, but we should do it now while we’re strong.

He likes the Yahoo-newspaper classified deal, that includes The Knoxville News Sentinel where I work, but says:

> Newspapers could have invented on-line classified. But they waited. Now they’re forced to get in bed with on-line publishers.

Coyle does see some business models in newspapers he'd like to see those in the NFL develop: the ability to do buisness with thousands of advertisers and have continuing relationships with those advertisers that generate volume. What could newspapers learn from the NFL? Tags: [NFL](https://technorati.com/tag/NFL) | [newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/newspapers)
