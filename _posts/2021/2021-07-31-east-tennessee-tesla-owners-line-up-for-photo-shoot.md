Tesla's [Knoxville Service Center](/2021/03/tesla-service-center-coming-to-knoxville/) is officially opening after a few weeks of a soft opening. As part of the grand opening, East Tennessee Tesla owners gathered Friday morning for a group pix of around 40 cars coordinated by the [Knoxville Electric Vehicle Association](https://knoxev.org/).

Here's my take on the event.

The Knoxville Service Center is at West Town Mall on the Montvue Road/Gleason Drive corner of the mall where a Sears Automotive Center once was.

If you are thinking of buying, feel free use my [Tesla referral code](https://ts.la/jack65708) for 1,000 free miles of supercharging with the purchase and delivery of Tesla.
