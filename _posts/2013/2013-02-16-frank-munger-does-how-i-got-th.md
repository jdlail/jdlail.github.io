He'll be using his coverage of the July 28, 2012 break-in at the Y-12 Nuclear Weapons Plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn. by three protesters to talk about:

* Using experience to advantage.
* How to create experience if you don't have it
* Using blogs to break news, build audience
* Sources, sources everywhere
