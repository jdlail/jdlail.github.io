A new Florida political web site was announced by E.W. Scripps today that leverages its newspapers and TV stations in the state.  
  
The new site is called [FLDemocracy2012.com](https://www.fldemocracy2012.com/). From the news release:  

"Given the role Florida will play in the election and the intense interest generated by what happens here, it made sense that a website should be developed that would serve as a consistent source of news and information on national and state politics related to the Sunshine State," said Mark Tomasik, editor of Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers. "By combining the resources of multimedia journalists at WPTV in West Palm Beach, WFTS in Tampa, the Naples Daily News and Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers, FLDemocracy2012.com will provide more thought-provoking coverage than any other media source in Florida."  

As usual, Florida is expected to be a pivotal state in the presidential campaign. A dedicated online producer will be in place for the site by early next year.
