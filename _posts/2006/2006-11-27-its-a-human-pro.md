Loved this quote from Dave Rand of Trend Micro in the [story](https://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/27/uk.spam.reut/) saying nine out of 10 emails are spam:

> "It will only end when people stop buying diet pills, herbal highs and sexual performance enhancers

> "The products they are selling by spam are exactly the same products that they sold in the Middle Ages. This really is a human problem, not a computer problem."
