I'll be participating in a group blog at the Newspaper Association of Ameria's CONNECTIONS confab starting this weekend in Orlando. See the blog [here](https://www.naa.org/blog/marketing2006/index.cfm). There's a group of 29 foks that volunteered to blog at the show -- heck, that's a virtual newsroom of writers. Should keep us out of trouble!
