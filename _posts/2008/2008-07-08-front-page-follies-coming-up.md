University of Tennessee journalism professor Jim Stovall says in an email that an especially good show is coming together for the East Tennessee SPJ's Front Page Follies on July 19, a fast-approaching Saturday night.  
  
Stovall says:  
  
> There has been plenty to spoof this year, and the show is hilarious. I know because I am in the cast. For instance, one of the songs we're doing this year is called Jailhouse Rocky Top, sung to the tune of Jailhouse Rock. Here's an excerpt from the script:  
>

> JAILHOUSE ROCKY TOP  
> (Tune:  Jailhouse Rock)  
>
> Ernie:  
> The Vols had a pep rally in the county jail, Half the team was there except those who made bail.  
>
> Clint:  
> The fans wore orange in a prison shade,  
> You shoulda heard the riot when the pep band played.  
>
> Chorus:  
> (Ernie, Clint, Megan, Kristina, David, Michael H., Alan) They rocked!  Everybody, they rocked!  
> Everybody in the whole cellblock  
> Was singin' "Jailhouse Rocky Top."  
>
> Ernie:  
> The Sheriff said to Fulmer, "I apologize "That circumstances led us to arrest your guys."  
>
> Clint:  
> Fulmer said, "Don't worry, Sheriff, that's all right.  
> "At least I know where they are tonight."  
>
> Repeat Chorus
