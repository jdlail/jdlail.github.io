![Cathy Clark](/images/picturethiscathyclarke.webp)Almost 11 months ago, Cathy Clarke, a News Sentinel photographer, was seriously injured in an automobile wreck while on assignment. See [earlier posts](/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=cathy+clarke&IncludeBlogs=25&limit=20).  
  
Some photo staff folks got together for a luncheon to present her with a Tennessee Associated Press Managing Editors' first place award in feature photography. The [winners](https://www.ap.org/tennessee/07%20TAPME%20Award%20Winners.htm) were announced in Nashville in July.
