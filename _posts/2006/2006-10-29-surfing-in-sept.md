Some good news for newspapers: [Newspaper Sites See Record Traffic in September](https://clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3623781) (via [Lost Remote](https://www.lostremote.com/2006/10/28/paper-sites-set-traffic-records-in-september/)).

> September was a banner month for online newspaper sites, which attracted more than 58 million readers that month ... This was the highest amount of unique visitors for paper sites ever, the industry group said.

Interestingly our [knoxnews](mailto:https://www.knoxnews.com/) traffic in August was better than September and October will better than both. Your results may vary. Tags: [Newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/newspapers)
