> _“We have to go from a world in which we try to do a better job of covering the same news as everyone else to a world where we’re bringing our audiences news that no one else is.”_

> \- From ABC News President David Westin at the Media Institute Awards dinner this week. A great quote, especially for local TV, which still spends a healthy part of the news day chasing each other on the same stories. The end result is most local TV sites in a given market have the same stories with similar designs, expediting the road to commoditization and uncertain futures.

Great advice for locally focused newspapers, too!
