I remember [Phillipe Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Kahn) primarily as the CEO of database and programming tool maker Borland International, but he is also credited with inventing the camera phone in 1997, yes, in 1997. And he's the only to [have a photo to prove it](https://allthingsd.com/20120203/philippe-kahns-first-camera-phone-set-to-star-in-best-buy-super-bowl-ad/), a photo shot of his newborn daughter on June 11, 1997. This video extends upon an ad Best Buy will air during the Super Bowl.
