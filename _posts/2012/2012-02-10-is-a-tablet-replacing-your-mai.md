Interesting survey. If you have a few minutes, help ~~grad student~~ full-time faculty member in the University of Kentucky Division of Instructional Communicatio Chas Hartman by taking it. He's trying to answer:  

* How is consumers' use of tablets such as [the iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad/ "iPad") and the [Kindle Fire](https://www.amazon.com/kindlefire "Kindle Fire") for gathering news and information impacting their use of laptops and desktop computers?
* How is consumers' use of digital applications to gather news and information impacting their use of traditional Web sites?
* How will consumers' needs and wants influence their future choices of technology for the purposes of communicating and gathering news and information?

From an email he is sending to prospective survey takers:  
  
Dear potential volunteer:  
  
Would you like to participate in an anonymous online survey about the ways in which you gather news and information? The survey will only take 5-10 minutes for you to complete, and your participation will provide data for my ongoing communication research. There are no known risks to participating in this study.
