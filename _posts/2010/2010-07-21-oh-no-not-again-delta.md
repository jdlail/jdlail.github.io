Knoxville-based newspaper consultant [Kevin Slimp's](https://www.facebook.com/kevinslimp "Kevin Slimp") luck with [Delta Air Lines](https://www.delta.com/ "Delta Air Lines") continues to be a muddled mess of delays and cancellations.  
  
A column Slimp wrote on a June trip to and from hell and the resulting customer service torture appeared on [KnoxvilleBiz.com](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/jul/18/word-flies-faster-than-airline/) on Sunday (we also wrote [about it](/2010/06/while-it-doesnt-reach-the.html) earlier).  
  
And so just yesterday on a flight from Knoxville to Bismarck, N.D. his Delta flight began to go horribly wrong in Memphis.  
  
He posted a Facebook update yesterday:  
  
> OK. I'm flying on ... you guessed it .. Delta today. Decided not to go through Atlanta. You just can't get from Knoxville to Atlanta. So I took the Memphis route. Mistake. Big Mistake. I hope to see you good folks in Bismarck tomorrow. This might require another rental car before it's over. Stay tuned ...  
>

Later in the evening, he said:  
  
> Latest Latest Update: My latest flight has been delayed from Memphis to Minneapolis. Yes, it's been 6 lovely hours here. Unless my flight from Minneapolis to Bismarck leaves late, chances are I will be ... yes, driving 8 hours in a rental car (from Midnight till 8) to be at my gig at 8 a.m. in Bismarck. Anybody got a s...pare tire? If anyone from Delta is reading this, go ahead and start writing the check.  
>

Below is a post after he finally made it to Bismarck, six hours late.
