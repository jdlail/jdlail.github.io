[Leonard Pitts Jr.](https://www.leonardpittsjr.com) writes a column for the Miami Herald that is syndicated nationally. He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2004 and is the author of "[Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=1932841172%20&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&index=books&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=ur2&o=1)." On June 3, he gave what a number of racial fringe groups and even conservative bloggers have been clamoring: A national stage for the issues swirling about the horrific January murders of [Channon Christian and Chris Newsom](https://www.knoxnews.com/kns/local_news/article/0,1406,KNS_347_5548779,00.html). But wait, Pitts has now been [targeted](https://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003600764) by white supremacists for his [column](https://www.miamiherald.com/285/story/125806.html). One said he would not shed a tear if some "loony" killed the writer. What'd Pitts do? Well, in putting the story in the limelight just like the fringe groups have been demanding, he didn't get the highly charged racial spin right. Let see some of the things Pitts said about the campaign to portray the young couple's murder as a racial hate crime:

> Part of me thinks I should consider the source and let this slide. But the argument being advanced here is so utterly, abysmally, stupidly, self-servingly wrong that I cannot help but respond.

> ... And here I'm obligated -- because I'm black -- to say that if the defendants in this case did what they are accused of doing, I'd be happy to see them rot under the jailhouse. Sadly, that needs saying because there are people who will not take it as a given.

> But with that obligation fulfilled, let me add that I am likewise unkindly disposed toward the crackpots, incendiaries and flat-out racists who have chosen this tragedy upon which to take an obscene and ludicrous stand. I have four words for them and any other white Americans who feel themselves similarly victimized.

> Cry me a river.

Media trade pub _[Editor and Publisher](https://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003600764)_ reported Tuesday that one site has published Pitts' home address and telephone number and the columnist has received threats. When the Miami Herald asked Roanoke, Va., based site Overthrown.com to remove the personal information, site editor Bill White said:

> We have no intention of removing Mr. Pitts' personal information. Frankly, if some loony took the info and killed him, I wouldn't shed a tear. That also goes for your whole newsroom.

Showing the love! Mr. White does understand hate. Tags: [channon christian](https://technorati.com/tag/channon christian) | [Chris Newsom](https://technorati.com/tag/chris newsom) | [racial hate crimes](https://technorati.com/tag/racial hate crimes)
