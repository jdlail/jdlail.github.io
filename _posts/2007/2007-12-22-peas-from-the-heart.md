![green peas](/images/green_pea-thumb-150x186.webp)Several of the Tennessee Twitterers I follow, [djuggler](https://twitter.com/djuggler), [rexhammock](https://twitter.com/rexhammock) and [newscoma](https://twitter.com/newscoma) among them, are participating in the frozen peas awareness and fundraising effort.  
  
Frozen peas endangered or in need of aid? Hardly.  
  
It's an effort inspired by Twitterer [Susan Reynolds](https://twitter.com/susanreynolds), who has been blogging about her breast cancer at [Boobs on Ice](https://susanreynolds.blogs.com/boobsonice/). She explains the peas in [this post](https://susanreynolds.blogs.com/boobsonice/2007/12/whats-with-the.html).  
  
Duncan Riley at TechCrunch notes the social significance of the [outpouring of support](https://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/21/can-you-spare-the-odd-pea-for-a-good-cause).  
  
There's a Frozen Pea Friday flickr [group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/frozenpeafriday/pool/) with 280 members (at this writing).. There is a f[rozen pea fund](https://frozenpeafund.com/) that has raised at least $3,500 in the wrapup report on Frozen Pea Friday.  
  
An interesting use and heartwarming use of Twitter. My best wishes to Susan Reynolds.
