Go get 'em [IAB](https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/07/digging_deeperthe_problem_with.html). _I always find that statistics are hard to swallow and impossible to digest. The only one I can ever remember is that if all the people who go to sleep in church were laid end to end they would be a lot more comfortable. ~ Mrs. Robert A.

It is ironic that the most measurable media ever created has such a hard time figuring out how to measure anything -- accurately.
