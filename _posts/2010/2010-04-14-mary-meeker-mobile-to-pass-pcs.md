Pay attention to what [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/ "Morgan Stanley")'s Mary Meeker says.  
  
That bit of advice [Bill Tallent](/2010/04/the-ipad-as-transformative-dev.html), CEO of Mercury Intermedia, passed along to the audience last Friday at the "Smart Phones for Smart Journalists" workhop at the John Seigenthaler Center on the Vanderbilt campus in Nashville.  
  
Coincidentally on Monday, [Mathew Ingram](https://www.mathewingram.com/media "www.mathewingram.com/media") of GigaOM, [did a post on Mary Meeker's predictions](https://gigaom.com/2010/04/12/mary-meeker-mobile-internet-will-soon-overtake-fixed-internet/) about mobile, a space in which the firm of Tallent makes its living developing applications.  
  
Meeker presented her latest "State of the Internet" at Google's headquarters on Monday afternoon.  
  
The two big ideas of her presentation are that in five years more people will connect to the Internet on mobile devices than desktop PCs and that social networking is already bigger than e-mail.  
  
Her whole presentation is in embedded in Ingram's post. Like Tallent said "pay attention" or you might end up with those who, as Meeker said on a slide, "Will Wonder What Just Happened."
