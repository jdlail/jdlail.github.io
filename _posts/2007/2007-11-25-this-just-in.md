Some thoughts on breaking news.  
  
Matt Drudge tells Britain's Sky News the secret to a good news Website is "[keep it jumping](https://news.sky.com/skynews/video/videoplayer/0,,31200-1293628,00.html)" and media writer Steve Outing says when it comes to [breaking news](https://www.steveouting.com/many-news-organizations-are-too-slow-with-breaking-news.html), "holding on to it for even a short while means you'll likely be beaten by eyewitnesses sharing what they know, and that information spreading virally."  
  
Outing [suggests](https://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=31&aid=133274) Twitter could be one platform for breaking news and got [some cool pointers](https://www.steveouting.com/group-twittering-instructions.html) from the Twitter folks.  
  
 Kevin Anderson in the UK picks up on Outing's thoughts and has some ideas of his own in "[Newspapers can break news again](https://strange.corante.com/archives/2007/11/23/newspapers_can_break_news_again.php)."  
  
I thought how a Knoxville computer programmer and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/djuggler) Doug McCaughan covered a high school football game Friday night was innovative:

McCaughan wasn't a journalist covering the game and his report would have never made [Drudge](https://www.drudgereport.com/). The story from the newspaper journalist covering the game, which appeared online later in the evening online and in the paper the next morning, was a better read.  
  
But McCaughan's Twitter posts had an immediacy that captured the drama and tension of a playoff game between two arch-rivals. It was breaking news to the people that wanted to know. It was news of the moment.  
  
**_Update_** : He blogs about [Twittering the high school game](https://realityme.net/2007/11/25/what-are-you-doing-with-your-phones/).  
  
And in one of those strange but true twists, if it had been done from the press box by a press credential bearing journalist at an NCAA sporting event, it likely would have been [verboten](https://www.bloggersblog.com/cgi-bin/bloggersblog.pl?bblog=620071) as play-by-play coverage. Journalist aren't the only ones who need to think in new ways.
