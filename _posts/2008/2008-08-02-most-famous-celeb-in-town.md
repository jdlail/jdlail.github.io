Who's the most famous celebrity in Knoxville (and I bet knoxnews TV columnist [Terry Morrow](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/telebuddy/) would get this one wrong).  
  
My guess is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSDFzg8_Wfg). This celeb has a video on YouTube with has over 3 million views. The most popular Johnny Knoxville video on YouTube, by contrast, has only 1.36 million views.
