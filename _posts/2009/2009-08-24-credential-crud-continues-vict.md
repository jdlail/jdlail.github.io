The Associated Press and Gannett say their reporters will not sign the new Southeastern Conference Media Credential Policy.  
  
> "The credential restrictions would be untenable," said Mark Silverman, editor of the Tennessean, which covers the SEC's University of Tennessee and Vanderbilt University. "They fail to recognize that we are not just a newspaper. We use a variety of mediums and I believe we are going to be able to make a prior restraint argument."
