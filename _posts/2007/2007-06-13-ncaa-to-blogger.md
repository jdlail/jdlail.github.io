> The NCAA is out of its mind.

That may not be news, but it is Steve Safran's take on the NCAA's [blogger blunder](https://www.thepomoblog.com/jun132007.html#ncaa). Michael Silence has several more [links](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2007/06/blogging_doesnt.shtml) to coverage of the ejection of a Kentucky sports writer for blogging at a college baseball game. And Silence has more [here](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2007/06/more_on_no_live_1.shtml), [here](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2007/06/more_on_getting_1.shtml), [here](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2007/06/a_blogging_grou.shtml) and [here](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2007/06/reporter_booted.shtml). Howard Weaver, the VP of News at McClatchy, did a [post](https://editor.blogspot.com/2007/06/getting-shut-out-in-sports.html):

> I think we can (and will) make strong legal arguments about our right to cover public events being held in (mainly) publicly owned venues. But even though legal options are naturally limited, there's a lot more involved here than legalities.

Dan Gillmor posted on it, [too](https://citmedia.org/blog/2007/06/11/newspaper-barred-from-blogging-basketball-game/):

> ... the paper should ask readers to blog the game themselves, from TV sets or from the stands, or both — and then point to the best reader game-blogs.

[Bryan Murley](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/blog/2007/06/11/ncaa-attempts-to-hold-back-new-media-tide/) points to more posts and says:

> This is idiotic on so many levels that it’s incredible that the NCAA would stoop to such stupidity. Wait, strike that.

Lots of others are [writing about it](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=%22brian+Bennett%22&btnG=Search+Blogs) as well. My bet is the NCAA will pretend the world is flat, that college athletes go to college primarily to get an education, and coaches will limit text messaging to recruits. And blogging during a game will continue to be verboten as long as ESPN says so. Course, I'm covering this game on a play-by-play basis so I suspect the NCAA roustabouts will roust me at any moment and yank my blogging credentials. Wait, I don't have any blogging credentials.
