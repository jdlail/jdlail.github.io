Listening to "Saturday Night House Party," my favorite blues radio show, on [WNCW](https://www.wncw.org/). If you've never heard it, give it a listen some Saturday night.

Good cross section of new stuff and classics, ranging across every blues style. From 7 to 10 p.m. followed by an hour long "House Party Live." They just cranked into a "drinking" set that started with Floyd Dixon doing "Hey Bartender," then rolled into John Lee Hooker's "One bourbon, one scotch, one beer" then Paul Mark and the VanDorens' "Drinkin on the job," followed by Albert Collins doing "I ain't drunk." Goood stuff.
