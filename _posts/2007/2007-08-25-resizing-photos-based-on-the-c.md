[Content-aware image resizing](https://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/context_aware_i.html) is an amazing technloogy.  Watch the[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-SSu3tJ3) to get an idea of how it works. I wonder how far it is from being adopted? Course, it brings up ethical issues. As the examples show, people or objects can just disappear from the resized photo.
