If you're like most people in the newspaper business, you started getting links late in the week to Walter Isaacson's piece in Time on "How to Save Your Newspaper," a topic I've thought a lot about in recent days, weeks, months and years. But in addition to Isaacson's thoughts, I decided to collect his pieces (the Time article, a speech and Huffington Post blog post) as well as the reaction to it for your weekend reading enjoyment.
