[Connected Tennessee](https://www.connectedtn.org/) is doing a "crowdsourcing" experiment to gather information on boradband availability in Tennessee.  
  
Use [this map to verify what's available](https://www.connectedtn.org/mapping/_interactive_map_interface/?q=map) in your neighborhood. If it needs correcting, [use this form](https://www.connectedtn.org/broadband-inquiry).  
  
The good news: 95 percent of Tennessee hosueholds have broadband available. The bad news: 110,000 rural households are completely unserved.
