In the spring of 2015 I participated in a [GoSmokies group hike](https://gosmokies.knoxnews.com/profiles/blogs/gosmokies-spring-event-lucky-7) near the Cosby Campground that included a stop at a cemetery that includes the grave of Ella V. Costner, known as the "Poet Laureate of the Smokies."

I had never heard of her, but I took a photo of her headstone.

What I did not know then was the woman often called "Miss Ella V. Costner" had a life that "Poet Laureate" does not begin to capture.

Years later while organizing photos, I came across the one of her headstone I had taken in 2015 and took a deeper dive.

I found a woman who lived an amazingly rich and varied life.

Here is an edited version of a timeline of her life generated by Google's[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) from my research. The source material are newspaper articles and an excellent 2012 Smokies Life magazine article by William A. Hart.

## A life lived big

February 20, 1894: Ella V. Costner is born in a two-room log cabin on Crying Creek, near Cosby Campground in the Smoky Mountains area called the Mountain Rest community. (She added the "V." after she became an adult because she just liked the way it sounded.)
