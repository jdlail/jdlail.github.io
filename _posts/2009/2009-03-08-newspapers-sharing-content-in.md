There hasn't been much buzz on this, but the Memphis Flyer [has a story](https://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/Content?oid=oid%3A56927).  
  
This expands upon the content sharing newspapers have done through the Associated Press for years. While still very early in the arrangement, the timing ... er ... the economy ... appears right for this Internet twist of an innovation to succeed.  
  
The sharing is possible in large part because each paper's Web site is publicly accessible, making sharing an efficient cut-and-paste task.  
  
Not that many months ago, just having a meeting on an idea like this would have problematic.
