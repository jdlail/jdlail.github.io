Good advice:  
  
> If your newspaper provides you with video training, realize it is just the beginning. For you to be successful, you'll need to take ownership of your evolving career. I'm always surprised at how many journalists in newsrooms demand training, but when their newspaper fails to deliver, they refuse to invest any of their own time in reinventing themselves.
