Two sites I spend my life on -- knoxnews and gosmokies -- won Edgies at the NAA Connections. That is great! Here's a [news release](https://www.naa.org/utilartpage.cfm?TID=NR&AID=7566).

It's always nice to be recognized by your peers and the Edgies honor the most creative and innovative work in the newspaper New Media space. A great group of people both at the News Sentinel and corporate New Media are very committed to doing their best. Go celebrate! The online innovator award winner -- the big honor that goes to an individual -- has some East Tennessee connections, too.

The winner was Lisa DeSisto, vice president/advertising at Boston Globe Media. She had been general manager of Boston.com until she got a big promotion with print and interactive advertising responsibilities. Her husband grew up in Morristown and his family still lives there. The couple has purchased over 40 acres in Cocke County near some family property. So maybe we'll see them around these parts sometime in the future?
