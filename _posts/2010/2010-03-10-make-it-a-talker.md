> I want to give you more, not less. I don't think McDonalds will assume that as long as you keep it in a yellow box, people will buy a smaller, drier Big Mac. Yet our industry seems to think people are so obligated to buy it, we can make something smaller and drier and people will still buy it. It's crazy. You have to create something that, whatever's in it, people in town are all going to be talking about. That's the edge that we've lost.

> Newspapers used to be seen as a utility. People used to ask, "Do you take the newspaper?" What we have to produce now is a product backed by marketing strategies that compels people to buy the product. It has to be of great value.

\-- [E.W. Scripps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._W._Scripps "E. W. Scripps") CEO Rich Boehne

That's from an interview in a [Northern Kentucky University publication](https://northernmagazine.nku.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=39:stop-the-presses&catid=3:features&Itemid=63) (hat tip to [David Oatney](https://oatneyworld.blogspot.com/2010/03/how-much-trouble-is-print-news-in.html "David Oatney")). Boehne, who runs the company I work for, also talks about journalism stenography vs. storytelling and says that the traditional media of newspapers, radio and television were just the warm up for the connected electronic grid of information that is really just at its beginnings.

To those who have been listening to what Boehne has been saying, his emphasis on journalism that creates compelling content and embracing multiple platforms to deliver that information is not a new message, but it bears noting. To extend his fast food restaurant analogy a bit further, he's asking publishers and editors to upsize their committment to serving communities.
