I sent some stats to Scott Karp on what I think is a pretty successful example of "[link journalism](https://publishing2.com/2008/11/21/link-journalism-drives-page-views-and-engagement/)." (Karp is credited with coining that term and has a company, [Publish2](https://www.publish2.com/), built around the concept.)  
  
Like articles, the reader interest in content that is a set of links varies with the subject matter, but in instances where readers want everywhere scrap of info, it's a phenomenal service to provide.  
  
Check out [his post](https://publishing2.com/2008/11/21/link-journalism-drives-page-views-and-engagement/) for the details.
