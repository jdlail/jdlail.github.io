[![500px-Propellersvg.png](/images/500px-Propellersvg-thumb-150x150.webp)](/images/500px-Propellersvg.webp)I gave up on Netscape when it morphed into [Propeller](https://www.propeller.com/), but Muhammad Saleen's [sneak peek and review](https://muhammadsaleem.com/2007/11/29/propellers-new-sight-design-mind-blowingly-awesome/) has me considering going back:
