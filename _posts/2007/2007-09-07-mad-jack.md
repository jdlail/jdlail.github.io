[![Jack Lail taken with the built-in n800 camera](/images/090607madjack-thumb-250x187.webp)](/images/090607madjack.webp)I wasn't really mad, but it looks that way. It looks bizarre! I was testing the camera on the Nokia n800 Internet tablet. It created a 640 pixel wide image.

Could be used in a pinch, but it'd be best to use a regular digital camera and use the n800 to transmit it or post it somewhere. (You cannot transfer photos to it via a USB cable). The camera can be used for Skype calls, too, if you're into that.
