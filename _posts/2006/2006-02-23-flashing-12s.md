OK, I don't know where I've been, but I had never heard the above term until Wednesday when I was listening to Rob Walch's talk on podcasting. But I love it.  Walch is president of [podCast411, Inc.](https://www.podCast411.com) He was speaking at the Newspaper Association of America's CONNECTIONS Conference in Orlando. He's written "Podcasting for Dummies." The [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=flashing+12) defines "Flashing 12's pretty much the same way as Rob did:

> A “Flashing 12” is a person with no technical inclinations' inept in all things technological. The name comes from the fact that when you walk into their house their VCR is Flashing 12:00, because they can not figure out how to program it.

Maybe I need "Slag for Dummies."
