Matt Waite has the right [idea](https://www.mattwaite.com/2007/05/01/stop-waiting-for-them-to-save-you/). Train yourself for the newsroom roles in demand. Could it get any easier than it is today? Call it _career sweat equity_. If you get training opps, make the most of them -- and share. Duh! No need to wait for the reorg memo.
