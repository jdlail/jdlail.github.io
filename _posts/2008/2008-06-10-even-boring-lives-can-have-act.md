I started experimenting over the weekend with an "action stream," a way of viewing one's activities on various social networking sites in an updating stream, a link blog of life.  
  
There is a relatively new [plugin](https://plugins.movabletype.org/action-streams/) for the Movable Type blog platform that implements this. After battling my own brainlessness for quite awhile, I got it implemented.  
  
See [my action stream](/actionstream/). Of course, there's an [RSS feed](https://feeds.feedburner.com/JackLailActivityStream).  
  
Does this "life stream" stuff have any value?
