The speed version of the better part of last week during my stay in Saint Louis. My hotel was just across the street from the arch, but, unfortunately, I never made it to it.  
  
Here are some resources and thought-starters from the Associated Press Managing Editors "Inspiration Starts Here" conference.  
  
[Amy Webb](https://www.mydigimedia.com/) did a rapid fire presentation on [trends to watch](https://www.webbmediagroup.com/APME2009.html). Val Hoeppner leveraged off Webb's list of trends with a blog post with a list of [cool resources and tools of particular interest to journalists](https://freedomforumdiversity.org/resources/2009/10/29/free-and-cheap-online-training-blogs-and-more/) and another set of resources was added to the [APME09 twitter stream](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23apme09) by the [Journalists Toolbox](https://www.journaliststoolbox.org/).  
  
And then there were [three great innovations](https://apme2009.com/2009/10/30/9-a-m-innovator-of-the-year-award/).  
  
Jill Geisler of the Poynter Institute had some advice for managing change in a presentation called [You're Not Crazy, Clueless or Cruel; You're Managing Change](https://apme2009.com/2009/10/28/managing-change-doesnt-make-you-crazy-clueless-or-cruel/). She had some links:

> * [Four barriers to collaboration

Michele McLellan blogged on one intriguing aspect being looked at in the credibility projects: [When to unpublish news](https://www.knightdigitalmediacenter.org/leadership_blog/comments/when_to_unpublish_news_almost_never/). Kathy English, public editor at the Toronto Star, is heading that effort and has produced this white paper called "[The Longtail of News](/pdf/apme-longtail-report.pdf)."  
  
And, oh yeah, there was the panel that Kurt Greenbaum of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and I were on involving [social media tools](https://apme2009.com/2009/10/30/10-a-m-session-social-media/).
