If you're still trying to figure out the whole Facebook thing, then here's a cheatsheet:

> * Over 150,000 registrants daily. That's 1 million a week since January. *35 million users today. Of course that number will be off a million one week from today.* Half user are outside college. That number was zero in Sept. 2006. *0ver 40 billion page views in May 2007* Average visitor stays 20 minutes *Most growth is among people over age 25.* 47,000 Facebook groups. *#1 photo sharing app on the web. 2.7 billion photos on site.* More than 2000 applications. The Top 10 are: Top Friends, Video, Graffiti, MyQuestions, iLike, FreeGifts, X Me, Superpoke!, Fortune Cookie & Horoscopes. The smallest of these has over 4.5 million users.
