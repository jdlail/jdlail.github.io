TV reporter Gordon Boyd's unfortunate "technical difficulties" have gone "randomly viral" on YouTube.  
  
The big social media blog Mashable [linked to it today](https://mashable.com/2010/03/11/reporter-freaks-out-video/) and the YouTube video has topped 137,000 views since being posted on March 5, 2010. [Here is the take](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2010/03/wvlt_channel_8.shtml) of the News Sentinel's Terry Morrow and also of [Metro Pulse](https://blogs.metropulse.com/the_daily_pulse/2010/03/a-boyd-out-of-hand-1.html).
