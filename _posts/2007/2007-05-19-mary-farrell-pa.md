I was testing out my video camera, a Panasonic SDR-S150, and shot this video of one of my favorite potters, Mary Farrell. She was kind enough to be my test subject.

Mary and her husband, David, are marking their 30th anniversary of operating [Westmoore Pottery](https://www.westmorepottery.com/) in the Westmoore area of northern Moore County, N.C. If I haven't bought at least one piece from them every year they've been open, it'd be close.

I love their pottery. They make pottery in the styles of pottery made in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries. She said she'd had a great time helping put together an exchibit at the [North Carolina Pottery Center](https://www.ncpotterycenter.com/) in nearby Seagrove that features the work of Farrells, Hal and Eleanor Pugh of New Salem, NC, and historical works from North Carolina drawn from private collections here and yonder. The exhibit is called "Slipped, Dipped and Dotted: 18th-21st Century North Carolina Redwares" and runs through Aug. 25, 2007.

On this Saturday afternoon, she was doing a demonstration for two children and me of how she decorates pottery. Later a photographer from the Asheoboro, NC, newspaper showed up to take some photos. If you are ever in the area, visit their shop. It's been featured in Country Living and Home and Garden magazine.
