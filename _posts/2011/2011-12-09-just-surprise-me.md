This month's [Carnival of Journalism](https://carnivalofjournalism.com/2011/11/27/join-in-decembers-carnival-of-journalism/) is themed for the holiday season.

> _With it being December, we thought we would adopt a Christmas theme for this month's topic - and pick something, in keeping with being hosted by a Developer blog, that we could ask of both technologists and journalists._

This is easy: I want surprises from developers and programmers!  
  
Not bug fixes or tweaks or enhancements or incremental improvements or iterations.  
  
I want a solution I didn't think of to a need.  
  
I want a solution to a need I didn't think of.  
  
More than I want to admit I am a prisoner of the paradigms of my profession, my industry, the culture of my company, and the work flows and tools I have at hand.  
  
I'm lucky to work with a few that do come up with ideas that amaze me.  
  
To make it happen, I think developers have to have blocks of free work time scheduled in. [Google's 20 percent time program](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/googleplex3.htm) is one company's well-documented effort to encourage this.  
  
Give me the creative side, the artist within, the where-did-that come-from.  
  
So, surprise me. Awe me with the wonderment of a wide-eyed four-year-old.  
  
And, oh yes, you don't have to wait until Christmas. Anytime is just fine.  
  
I think you will find the other [Carnival wish lists somewhere around here](https://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/nov/24/carnival-of-journalism) within a few days.
