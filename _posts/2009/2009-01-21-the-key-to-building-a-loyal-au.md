Dave Winer [points](https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1136025328) to a 2005 [blog post](https://www.scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3) to remind us that a maxim of the Internet is:  
  
> Now the fundamental law of the Internet seems to be the more you send them away the more they come back. It's why link-filled blogs do better than introverts. It may seem counter-intuitive -- it's the new intuition, the new way of thinking. The Internet kicks your ass until you get it. It's called linking and it works.

> People come back to places that send them away. Memorize that one.
