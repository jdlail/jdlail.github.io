An effort I'm involved with at E.W. Scripps to have editors and online directors redefine the company's strategies and to hire 40 paid interns across the company to help free us a bit from the day-to-day demands so we will have the time to take a penetrating look at what the company's newspapers need to do to grow a future, and then do it, is getting some attention, perhaps, did I detect, praise.  
  
Ken Doctor, a news industry analyst and author of "[Newsonomics: Twelve New Trends That Will Shape the News You Get](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312598939?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312598939)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0312598939)," wrote [about it](https://newsonomics.com/up-from-skunkworks-scripps-look-inward-and-outward-for-growth/) today, saying:  
  
> For newspaper companies, it's time to re-start the engines. One big question is how. One somewhat new answer is coming, in differing flavors, from companies like Scripps, Journal Register and Hearst. Each is newly trying to involve its staffs in charting new directions for the news companies. ... Scripps' effort, being formally announced tomorrow, is the most ambitious in scope.

As Doctor observes, the challenge for those of us involved is to make this effort at transformation, culture change and retooling (_pick a buzzword_) work where so many previous mornings of _today is the first day of the rest of your life_ haven't. It's tough, mentally sweaty work in the greasy nuts and bolts. It's a calendar of conference calls, deadlines, and report outs. It's difficult consensus building in an uncertain environment where everyone points in a different direction when you say _which way?_  
  
There's a difference between talking and doing; between opining and executing; between white papers and quantifiable results.  
  
Wish us luck; we're about the latter!
