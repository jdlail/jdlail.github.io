Knoxnews' Talid Magdy recorded one of my favorite musicians, [Tim O' Brien](https://www.timobrien.net/ "Tim O'Brien \(musician\)"), at a recent [WDVX](https://www.wdvx.com/ "WDVX") Blue Plate show. O'Brien has a new CD out, [Chicken and Egg](https://timobrien.net/). This video is of him doing "Suzanna," which is on the CD.  
  
[O'Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_O%27Brien_%28musician%29), who first came to my attention as a member of the Colorado-based band [Hot Rize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Rize) has long been one of my favs -- and for good reason!  
  
Magdy posted a couple of other videos of O'Brien as well:
