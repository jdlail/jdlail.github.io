![Twitter Upgrades](/images/grab_twitter_cat.webp) With the flash flood of attention, Twitter has had some growing pains. It got slow (it's better, but still can be slow). Features disappeared (they're still gone). People started whining (and probably still are). Twitter's seemingly everywhere buzz could have developed into a Red Tide. But it hasn't. I think that's because they doing blog posts like this one: [Twitter Blog: The Tortoise and the Twitter](https://twitter.com/blog/2007/03/tortoise-and-twitter.html). It does the job of addressing the problems in a serious but playful way and lets people know what is going on and that it'll get better -- soon. Instead of the rants they were getting yesterday, the commenters now are generally understanding and making suggestions. Note to self. Might be a good tactic to emulate when the need arises.
