Thursday was the college [signing ceremony](https://www.lailnet.com/news/archives/2008/11/signing-ceremony-at-bearden-hi.html) for our son, Mark, at his high school. We experimented a bit using a new [Nokia N96](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DN5030?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001DN5030)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001DN5030) cellphone to [stream video to Qik](https://qik.com/knoxnews#v=561986). Worked well except it's hard to shoot video, take photos with a digital camera at the same time, and be in some of the photos.
