![journalism.co.uk](/images/journalismcouk.webp)![](file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/Jack/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot.webp)Journalism.co.uk recently started [doing a series](https://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/category/social-media-journalist/) where it is asking journalists across the globe about social media and how they see it changing their industry.  
  
I was game to [give it try](https://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/2008/03/14/social-media-journalist-usg-is-the-most-overrated-social-media-news-craze-jack-lail-knoxville-news-sentinel/).  
  
I think I asked more questions than I answered.  
  
It did make me realize Social Media is such a nebulous concept that I'm not sure what people are talking about when they use the term. I have a concept of it, but I'm not sure it's their concept.
