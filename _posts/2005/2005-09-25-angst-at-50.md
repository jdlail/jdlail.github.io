I didn't mention this here when it happened … I didn't want to dwell on it. I turned 50 on the 16th. It sounds old; it doesn't feel that way. Thirty was OK, 40 was OK. .... 50 ... hmmm ... not so OK. I'm not really buying "50 is the new 30." jingle phrase ... 60 is the new 40 and if you're in you're 30s, you're in your teens!  I'm not sure who first used that phrase: Let's blame [Oprah](https://www.oprah.com/omagazine/200401/omag_200401_mission.jhtml). Who knows, maybe she never said it, but Billy Bob has.

> "Brown is the new black and 50 is the new 30."

[\-- Billy Bob Thornton](https://www.glidemagazine.com/articles193.html) I don't need [this](https://www.stickergiant.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=dc213) The idea of "Second Adulthood" popularized by [Gail Sheehy's](https://www.gailsheehy.com/) "Passages" work sounds positive. I've been telling people "I'm just halfway."

> "Most of us find ourselves, at 50, in a strange and uncomfortable time warp."

[\-- Gail Sheehy](https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/sheehy-passages.html) Sounds positive, doesn't it? Well, it gets better. Read the whole [first chapter](https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/sheehy-passages.html) to get the drft of it. Here's an [interview](https://www.menweb.org/sheehyiv.htm). I found her [Web site](https://www.gailsheehy.com) a bit hookie, but I'm 50. Maybe she really meant:

> "Growing old is not for sissies"

\-- Bette Davis But I found this quote to the most comforting:

> "Sure, I'm for helping the elderly. I'm going to be old one day myself."

\-- Lillian Carter (in her 80s) Now, that was a rare lady.
