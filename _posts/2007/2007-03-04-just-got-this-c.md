![My Grandparents](/images/Mamal%26PapalEdwardsXmasCard.webp) My cousin, Eddie Sudduth in North Carolina, emailed today this Christmas card of my grandparents, Hobert (1897-1973) and Emma (1903-1991) Edwards.I don't know when this card was done, but it's certainly more than three decades ago. Thanks for sharing!
