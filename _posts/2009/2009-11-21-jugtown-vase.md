[![Jugotown Vase](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2775/4121518647_3051069c38.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/4121518647/ "Jugtown Vase")  
At the [Celebration of Seagrove Potters](https://www.celebrationofseagrovepotters.com/) on Friday night, I picked up this vase made by Travis Owens of [Jugtown Pottery](https://www.jugtownware.com/). Jugtown was recently featured on a PBS [Craft in America show](https://www.pbs.org/craftinamerica/origins_2.html) and Travis Owens is in that segment.  
  
The Celebration continues through Sunday if you happen to be in Piedmont area of North Carolina. It's in the former Luck's Bean plant in Seagrove on N.C. 705 (also known as the NC Pottery Highway).
