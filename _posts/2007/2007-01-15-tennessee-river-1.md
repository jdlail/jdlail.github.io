[![Lakeshore Greenway](/images/01152007_DSC_0007-thumb.webp)](/images/01152007_DSC_0007.webp) I always like this view of the Tennessee River from atop the hill at the [Lakeshore Greenway](https://www.ci.knoxville.tn.us/greenways/lakeshore.asp). Today the temperature was 66 when this was taken, but there was a good breeze (wind gusts of 25 mph forecast) and you can see the gray line of a band of clouds moving in. By Wednesday, the [forecast](https://www.srh.noaa.gov/forecast/MapClick.php?CityName=Knoxville&state=TN&site=mrx) is the high will only reach 39. Weird winter weather, but I love the warm breaks.
