week, but it was a few weeks later when his blog caught national and international attention in the 9/11 terrorists attacks.  
  
He has built a large and loyal audience based on his sharp curation and commentary on everything from Fed monetary policy to the best gas grills. That he has maintained a prodigious daily output of tidbits, links, news and opinion for a decade is nothing short of remarkable.

Congratulations on passing a milestone worth noting and what will he be saying on the 20th?
