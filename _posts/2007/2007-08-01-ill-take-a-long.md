The "[long neck](https://www.andydickinson.net/2007/08/01/bin-your-digital-strategy/)" concept is a new one on me.

Andy Dickinson says it's basically a 25:5 rule ... _The 25:5 rule states that at least 25 percent of demand is for 5 percent of tasks; that 5 percent of content is read by 25 percent of people._

A shortcut: 5 percent of the content generates an outsized 25 percent of the value. The "long neck" is at the other end of the "[long tail](https://longtail.typepad.com/)." Gerry McGovern aays he [discovered](https://www.gerrymcgovern.com/nt/2006/nt-2006-08-14-long-neck.htm) it.

My reading of McGovern's concept is figure out the top 5 percent things people want to use your Web site for and focus on making those killer applications/services/features. That's the long neck. Put a big hunk of your money/time/resources into this small percentage of your business that is really driving the activity.

> If you identify your Long Neck and focus your resources on making the tasks within the Long Neck better, then you will create more value. You will do a better job and you will ultimately get a greater reward.

For the application of the concept to a media organization's site, Dickinson says:

> A large part of what many journalists talk about is compelling storytelling and engaging with community. Compelling content targeted at a mature audience who recognise the brand. Everyone would see that as core to driving the business. Right? But in truth it seems to be a very small part of the outworking of peoples digital strategy.

> Look at that apparently small part of your operation that’s generating all the activity – the 5% producing the 25%. Do they make up the smallest part of your digital investment?

Usually the answer is yes, but it should be no.
