[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/ "The Wall Street Journal") is among the most [liberal media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias "Media bias") outlets in the U.S., more liberal than the [New York Times](https://www.newyorktimes.com/ "New York Times") and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/ "NPR"). And the [Drudge Report](https://www.drudgereport.com/ "Drudge Report") is left leaning, yes, left leaning, more left leaning than [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/ "CNN").  
  
One study found:  
  
> The most important factor driving the slant of a given newspaper is ... the political leanings of the people who buy it. In other words: newspapers are giving the people the news that they want.
