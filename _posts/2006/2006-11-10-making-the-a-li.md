Oh, wow, this [book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446526568?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0446526568)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0446526568) doesn't come out until February, but it looks like it'd be great. And the "How-to-tell-an-asshole" rule on author Bob Sutton's blog [Work Matters](https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/) is classic (even if he found it elsewhere):

> New Rule: The more complicated the Starbucks order, the bigger the asshole. If you walk into a Starbucks and order a "decaf grande half-soy, half-low fat, iced vanilla, double-shot, gingerbread cappuccino, extra dry, light ice, with one Sweet-n'-Low and one NutraSweet," ooh, you're a huge asshole.

I also love the list of things that assholes do? I'm sure you recognize someone(s) here on Guy Kawasaki's [site](https://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/10/you_have_to_lov.html). Before I knew this was a "business trend" I had heard an executive often say that when starting up their new venture, the original management group had one rule: "No assholes." No matter how talented, no matter how many connections they had, no matter how much business they could generate, they wouldn't hire an asshole. It served that enterprise well. It was fabulously successful and on a daily basis, they didn't have to put up with ... My Starbucks order: _ah_... Columbian black, please.
