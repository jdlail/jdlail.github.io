I'm getting excited about a great panel I'm moderating at the [Associated Press Media Editors](https://apme.com/) Conference in Nashville on Friday, Sept. 21, 2012. You remember rock super-groups? I think I've got a digital super-group for the panel.

The morning panel is called "You First Saw This on Twitter and Facebook" and it's part of "Social Media Day" at the APME Conference being held at the John Seigenthaler Center.

The panel hopes to explore how getting the word out has changed for companies and organizations  There should be some great insights and useful tips.

Here's my super-group of panelists:
