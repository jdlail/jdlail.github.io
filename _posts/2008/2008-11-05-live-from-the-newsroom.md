[![Newsroom TV](/assets_c/2008/11/110508webtv-thumb-150x76.webp)](/images/110508webtv.webp)Online Editor Jigsha Desai tested, debugged and planned live streaming in the Knoxville News Sentinel newsroom Tuesday night as part of our election coverage on [knoxnews.com](https://www.knoxnews.com/). Not quite MSNBC or even the movie [The Front Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021890/), but reaction has been favorable. You're likely to see us use it again. We were using [Mogulus](https://www.mogulus.com/), a Web site that was also [being used on election night](https://www.mogulus.com/blog/?p=706) by a number of other media companies.  
  
We'd love to hear [your feedback here](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/roll/2008/11/no-holograms-here-only-live-vi.html).
