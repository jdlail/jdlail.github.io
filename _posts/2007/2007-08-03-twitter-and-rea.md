The "what is Twitter" discussion [continues](https://publishing2.com/2007/08/02/twitter-is-a-publication/). Scott Karp's take is one of the better ways of descrbing it to people who have never used it, but even he says _"If I’ve failed to explain Twitter to you, that probably means you’re a real person."_ If you have the answer, [Twitter me](https://twitter.com/jacklail). Course, I might not be a "real" person. Tags: [Twitter](https://technorati.com/tag/twitter)
