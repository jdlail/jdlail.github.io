Headed to the [Center for Innovation in College Media's](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/) spring workshop (The Future of Journalism: Tool Up or Take it to the House) in Nashville tomorrow. The sessions are Friday and Saturday at the really nice First Amendment Center on the Vanderbilt campus. Jennifer Carroll, vice president of new media content for Gannett, gives the keynote. The center describes itself as "a non-profit think-tank that was created to help college student media adapt and flourish in the new media environment." Way cool. I can't think of anything that's needed more in young people hoping to have careers in journalism than the ability to adapt and to be adept with the varied tools of new media. I hope the folks I talk to come away feeling like they got a lot from the sessions. It sounds like fun. The center has a nice blog as well [here](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/blog/).
