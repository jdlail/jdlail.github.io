Should I make something of this fun with Google Analytics?  
  
In the latter half of June, long-time leader "oral sex" was displaced as the top search engine query that brought visitors to this blog in a rolling 30-day period. It was displaced by "graduation message." Hmmm ...  
  
The top 10 search terms resulting in visits to jacklail.com in the latest rolling 30 day period are:  
       

  1. graduation message
  2. oral sex
  3. jack lail
  4. twitter aps
  5. barbara bain
  6. where do people get their news
  7. random mumblings
  8. find sex offenders in your neighborhood
  9. family reunion blog
  10. iphone sex
