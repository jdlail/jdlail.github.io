A castle buried at Jockey’s Ridge State Park in Nags Head on North Carolina's Outer Banks has emerged from the dune's shifting sands, according to The News & Observer in Raleigh.

Social media posts started appearing in November about the castle, which has 10 to 15 feet exposed and is thought to have perhaps another 10 to 15 feet under the sand that [could be exposed for the first time in decades](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article281901363.html), the newspaper said.

Above is a photo I took of the castle sometime in the 1990s and it was well exposed at that time.

Below is recent posting on Facebook.

The castle was part of a miniature golf course that operated in the late 1970s through the late 1980s. Parts of the course are believed to be under 30 to 40 feet of sand, park superintendent Joy Greenwood told the News & Observer.

This is the most exposed the castle has been in 15 plus years, she said.

The stat park includes Jockey's Ridge, which [its website calls](https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/jockeys-ridge-state-park)"the tallest living sand dune system on the Atlantic coast.' It is 80 to 100 feet high, depending on the weather.
