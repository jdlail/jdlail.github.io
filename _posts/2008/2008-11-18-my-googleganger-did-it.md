Looking at [Google trends](https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends) is one of my diversions.  
  
Sometimes gamed or "Google bombed," often weird and very often a good early indicator of mass trends or crazes.  
  
Among the top 10 early this morning was the term: Googleganger. It's not a new word, it's been around at least a couple of years and why it is hot today I have no clue.  
  
Odds are, you have a Googleganger.  
  
Your Googleganger is someone who has the same name as you who appears when you "Google" yourself.  
  
It comes from combining Google with [Doppelg�nger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger), which refers to a look-alike. No less than the [American Dialect Society](https://www.americandialect.org/Word-of-the-Year_2007.pdf) voted it the "most creative word of 2007."  
  
As a journalist, I find Google trends to be a very useful way of looking at how people are reacting to news (broadly defined). I'd love to hear how other people use it or view it in the comments _(hint, hint)_.
