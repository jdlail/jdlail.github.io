![icopyright](/images/icopyright.webp)iCopyright has been getting some pub this week with the announcement of a deal with AP.  
  
We've been using [iCopyright](https://www.icopyright.com/) or its technology for a several years on [knoxnews](https://www.knoxnews.com/) and I've always liked how it works. When i first saw it, it was like, wow, it's basically all self-service? And in most cases, it is.  
  
It's not meant as a way to keep grandma from emailing an article to Aunt Suzie, but rather a way to efficiently manage commercial reuse. And in these days of dwindling resources at newspapers, that's more important than ever.  
  
Here's a some coverage from [PaidContent](https://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-aps-annual-meeting-icopyright-deal-and-more) and some from the Seattle firm's own [blog](https://icopyright.blogspot.com/2008/04/icopyright-provides-article-tools-for.html).  
  
Best of luck to the company.
