[Some nice coverage of the panel on comments](https://apmeblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-to-make-comments-engaging.html) I moderated at the APME Conference in Denver with David Arkin of Gatehouse Media, Bobby Burton of 247Sports and Steve Buttry of the Journal Register Co.  
  
It was a great discussion and highlighted several different directions for effective comment management.
