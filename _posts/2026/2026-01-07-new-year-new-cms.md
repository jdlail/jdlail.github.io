After years of hosting my own site on Wordpress I have moved it to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

It came down to three things:

- I am blogging infrequently and maintaining a web server and a Wordpress instance just didn't seem worth it.
- I am a big fan of [Markdown](https://relston.github.io/markdown/writing/2024/07/31/why-use-markdown.html) and like the idea of my content source files being in Markdown.
- I am hosting on [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) for [free](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

Jekyll isn't a new CMS, some say it's [dead](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/is-the-jekyll-project-dead/6820) already with not much development happening, but it's integration with Github is attractive.

The migration took a few hours with the help of Gemini and a lot of steps and I'm still have features and tweaks to add.

Jekyll is a static site generator and that means it loads fast. And there is no admin to be hacked.

Of course,  website traffic has fallen — and continues to fall — due in large part to Google's AI Overviews (a fantastic feature for users). But I'm still here!
