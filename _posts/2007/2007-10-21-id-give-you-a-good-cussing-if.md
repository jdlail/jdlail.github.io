Random thoughts on cursing, cussing and dirty words in general.  
  
Steven Pinker uses 5,200 words to explain why we we curse in The New Republic article [Why we curse](https://www.tnr.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20071008&s=pinker100807), but he could have just stuck with "To begin with, it's a fact of life that people swear"  
  
It's interesting that The New Republic decided not to use [the illustration](https://www.drawger.com/atomic/index.php?section=comments&article_id=4285) that was created for the article.  
  
A lot of people have happily picked up on this report that [Swearing at work 'boosts team spirt, morale](https://rawstory.com/news/afp/Swearing_at_work_boosts_team_spirt__10172007.html)' But it's not likely to win friends in HR.  
  
And then there are [words that sounds dirty that aren't](https://wordie.org/people/TBTabby?wl=10190).  
  
And ones that should never be used in an [email subject line](https://www.subscribermail.com/downloads/seven_dirty_words.pdf).
