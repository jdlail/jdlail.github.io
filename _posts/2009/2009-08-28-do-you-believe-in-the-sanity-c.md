The Southeastern Conferencde issued a revised Media Credental Policy on Thursday that comes a lot closer to being acceptable.  
  
Writing on the Associated Press Sports Editors' [Web site](https://apse.dallasnews.com/news/2009/aug/082709credential_agreement.html), John Cherwa, chair of the organization's legal affairs committee, said: "The Southeastern Conference (SEC), upon the urging of ASNE, APME and APSE, has significantly revised its sports credential policy in several areas. It will now be up to individual members to decide if the changes are enough to warrant the signing of the credential."
