Some quotes to think about in the din on the death of newspapering:

> Remember, it's not raining on us; it's just raining.

\-- [Howard Weaver](https://editor.blogspot.com/2007/03/its-not-raining-on-you-its-just-raining.html)

> I don’t think its quite in the same boat as, say, the telegraph.

\-- [Deep Jive Interests](https://www.deepjiveinterests.com/2007/03/28/print-media-not-dead-but-not-quite-alive-sort-of-a-living-death/)

> Industrial grade paper just isn't the medium of choice for news anymore and reporters aren't the only people who can cover events and provide informed perspectives.

\-- [Susan Mernit](https://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2007/03/pile-on-to-declare-print-newspapers.html)

> There’s no question that the paper part of the business is decreasing in importance, and news may no longer be primarily distributed on smashed-up trees. Does that change the nature of the business? Definitely.

\-- [Mathew Ingram](https://www.mathewingram.com/work/)

> If only it were that easy. You don’t just flick a switch and turn this stuff on. It requires learning, training and a shift in culture. It requires planning, investment and, most of all, time.

\-- [Shane Ricmond, online for the Telegraph](https://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/mar07/stopme.htm), talking about how to build a successful newspaper online product. (via [Matthrew Ingram](https://www.mathewingram.com/work/2007/03/26/independent-just-another-word-for-wrong/)) The latest round of death of newpapers, sparked by Tim O'Reilly's post last weekend, has been [well covered](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=tim+o%27reilly+newspapers) by some very thoughful people. These were just of the recent ones that struck a chord with me. Tags: [death of newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/death of newspapers)
