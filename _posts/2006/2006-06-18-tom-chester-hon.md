Tom Chester, a co-worker at the Knoxville News Sentinel and deputy managing editor, is passionate about his job, is exceptionally good at it and thrives on the breaking story. Being the honoree at the Follies, an annual event that raises money for a journalism scholarship, is well-deserved. (On right is a cell phone shot of Tom before the dinner began at the Knoxville Convention Center.) Colleague Michael Silence has a posting [here](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2006/06/congrats_tom_1.shtml). And here's an article from the local SPJ chapter's [newsletter](https://www.discoveret.org/etspj/Feb06spot.pdf).
