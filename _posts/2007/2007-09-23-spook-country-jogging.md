Was listening to an audio version this week of [William Gibson's Spook Country](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=0399154302&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&index=books&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=ur2&o=1).  I will be listening to that for awhile; it's 11 hours and 3 minutes. Here's a link to an audio interview by [Amazon with the author](https://www.amazon.com/gp/mpd/permalink/8127:8124). 

I was pretty slow. At least two days it was very hot when I got out to jog.
