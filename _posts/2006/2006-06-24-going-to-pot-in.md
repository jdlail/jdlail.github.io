[Marsha Mercer](https://washdateline.mgnetwork.com/index.cfm?SiteID=WSH&PackageID=46&fuseaction=article.main&ArticleID=4929&GroupID=222), Media General's Washington Bureau chief, has a nice piece on a "[mug quest](https://www.shns.com/shns/scrippsnews/index.cfm?action=detail&pk=MERCER-06-25-06)" to one of the places I grew up in -- and like to return to often. Apparently, it drew her back, too, for it wasn't her first trip. She says she detoured to [Seagrove](https://maps.yahoo.com/beta/index.php#maxp=search&q1=+seagrove,+north+carolina&mvt=m&trf=0&lon=-79.772415&lat=35.540328&mag=7), NC, while on a work assignment. She captures the flavor of the rural town and tells its story in visits with several area potters (buying pottery in Seagrove is more like visiting relatives and taking something home than shopping at the mall), including [Jugtown](https://www.jugtownware.com/), [Turn and Burn](https://www.turnandburnpottery.com/) and [Dirtworks](https://www.discoverseagrove.com/nc-potters-details.asp?Potter_ID=16).

At one point in her visit, she says:

> "I realize then I'd come for more than a new mug. I'd come for a new memory."

She doesn't say whether she stopped for a bite to eat at [The Jugtown Cafe](https://www.seagrovepotteries.com/The%20Jugtown%20Cafe.htm), but if not, there's always next time she feels Seagrove drawing her back for a connection to another time and place. _(The photo at right is one of my favorite coffee mugs that I use weekly.
