The most ironic angle to surface so far in the AP vs Drudge Retort copyright/fair use flap is the [suggestion of an ethical lapse](https://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/18/the-nytimes-is-conflicted-and-wrong-about-the-ap-and-needs-to-stop-defending-them/) in the New York Times' coverage of the tempest by failing to disclose it is among the "owners" of the news service.  
  
Which leads me to a question: Who forgot newspaper media companies were the owners of the Associated Press first? The AP or the newspapers? Oh, well, that's a thought for another day.  
  
The Knoxville News Sentinel's very own [Michael Silence](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence) weighs in on AP v Drudge Retort with interviewer [Ed Driscoll](https://eddriscoll.com/)on Pajamas Media's 6 p.m. Thursday "PMJ Political" radio show on [XM Channel #130](https://www.xmradio.com/onxm/channelpage.xmc?ch=130). They also [archive them](https://pajamasmedia.com/?cat=-208&s=ed+driscoll).
