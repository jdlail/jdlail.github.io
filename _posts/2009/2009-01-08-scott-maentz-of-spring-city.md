[![Knoxville Greekbreakfast](https://twitxr.com/image/147973/)](https://www.twitxr.com/jacklail/updates/147973/ "Knxoville Greekbreakfast")[Scott Maentz](https://bigbaldguy.com/index.php/2008/12/19/knoxville-geek-breakfast-scheduled/), pictured at right, of Spring City, organized what may have been Knoxville's first "Geek Breakfast" this morning at the IHOP on Lowell Road.  
  
It was a networking opportunity, but he also encouraged people to bring peanut butter or tuna for Second Harvest.  
  
It was a great idea and seemed very received.  
  
Here are couple of his twitters on the event
