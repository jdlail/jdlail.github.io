I took an exercise holiday over the Christmas/New Year's period (not a good idea), but I'm trying to get back in the routine.  The chart below has last week's results.  
  
I also looked at last year and was surprised by actually how much I had accomplished considering how easily I can miss my schedule. (I track this stuff at [polarpersonaltrainer.com](https://www.polarpersonaltrainer.com/), which is great if you have a Polar "watch.")  
  
So here is the picture for 2007: I logged 533.71 miles either jogging or walking (running would be euphemism) at the track or using an elliptical machine, treadmill or stationary bike. Not great, but not bad for someone as athletically disinclined as I. I averaged three exercise sessions a week and averaged 10.264 miles a week (not all the sessions are running; I loath weights, too).
