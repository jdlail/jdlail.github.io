[Bobby Schweizer](https://www.bobbyschweizer.com/) talks about the news game he is helping develop called "The Cartoonist." He was among the students talking about their projects at the [GVU Fall Research Showcase at Georgia Tech](https://www.gvu.gatech.edu/research-showcase) on Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2011.

The showcase was a fascinating look into what the students were researching, testing or developing. There's some great stuff going on there. (I did an [earlier blog post on another project](/2011/10/foursquare-gets-pissed.html) I saw there)

Here's some coverage about Schweizer, news games and "The Cartoonist."
