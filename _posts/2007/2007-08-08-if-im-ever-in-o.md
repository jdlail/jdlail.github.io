I've become a fan of TNT's 'Saving Grace' that started coming on TNT in July. Totally surreal premise, but, hey, I've got a lot of practice at suspending disbelief. _You're headed for hell, Grace, but God's given you one last chance. He sent me to help you._ \-- Earl, the guardian angel. Not exactly Jimmy Stewart and "It's A Wonderful Life." Holly Hunter makes it work as the cynical and saucy Oklahoma City detective Grace Hanadarko. I hope the scripts continue to be fresh as the episodes I've seen. I really like the theme song, "Saving Grace" by Everlast. He does it with some promotional video of the show in the YouTube video above. Give it a listen; good song. Everybody could use a guardian angel and a little Saving Grace, couldn't they?
