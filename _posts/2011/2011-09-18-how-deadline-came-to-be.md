I shot a couple of short interviews with [Curt Hahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curt_Hahn "Curt Hahn") and Hunter Atkins of the movie "[Deadline](https://deadlinefilm.com/)," which had its first private screening on Sept. 15, 2011 at the Associated Press Media Editors Conference in Denver. The movie is based on a true story and adapted from a novel, [Grievances](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1588381927/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1588381927)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=1588381927&camp=217145&creative=399369), by Mark Ethridge, former managing editor of the [Charlotte Observer](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/ "The Charlotte Observer").  
  
It's a cold case tale featuring [investigative journalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism "Investigative journalism"). Some of it was filmed in the newsroom of [The Tennesseean](https://www.tennessean.com/ "The Tennessean").  
  
The real story involved a Charlotte Observer investigation of an unsolved murder in South Carolina. In the movie, the location has been moved to a Nashville newspaper and a small town in Alabama because the movie production company is based in Nashville.  
  
Look for it in your town next year.
