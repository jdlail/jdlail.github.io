A video of the negotiations between the Knoxville media and Bud Ford, the University of Tennessee's Associate Athletics Director - Media Relations (Men) - Football, before the press conference where head football coach Lane Kiffin announced he was leaving Tennessee for the head coaching job at the University of Southern California.  
  
Kiffin wanted to do two press conferences, one without cameras and one with. No questions apparently were going to be allowed at either. He also did not want any live feeds either video or audio.
