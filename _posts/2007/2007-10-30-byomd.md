What? Well, it's really the Washington Post's Rob Curley at the CMA/ACP National College Media Convention. But there's not a more passionate evangelist for journalists to get their careers saved by adapting and adopting. And for those that don't listen, there's career fire and brimstone awaiting.  
  
[Give it a listen](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/blog/2007/10/29/cma-wrap-up-5-rob-freakin-curley). The advice holds as true for aspiring journalists as veterans. Better to listen to him than me. After a talk I gave to a group of journalists, one blogged that I was "[such a bore](https://tennessonian.blogspot.com/2007/10/our-class-took-field-trip-to-knoxville.html)."
