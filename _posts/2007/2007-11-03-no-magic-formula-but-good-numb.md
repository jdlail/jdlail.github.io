Great stuff from Andy Dickinson on video [workload average time](https://www.andydickinson.net/2007/11/03/video-workload-survey-results/). The wide range in video production times shows it's not that easy yet to have a pat 1 minute of video equals X in work time. And the reasons he notes vary from training to type of project.
