I agree with [Julie Starr](https://evolvingnewsroom.co.nz/old-films-and-the-age-of-the-stone?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+EvolvingNewsroom+%28Evolving+Newsroom%29&utm_content=Google+Reader); these old newspaper videos from the 1950s are great. She has some others on in her blog post. Give them a look.  
  
Somehow I don't believe the "push this button" system we have today would make as interesting a video. Fifty years from now, however, printed newspapers themselves will seem as quaint and foreign as the production processes show here.  
  
_Do you realize, they printed pages of paper and delivered them, mind you, in the wee hours of the morning to your home. Can you imagine?_
