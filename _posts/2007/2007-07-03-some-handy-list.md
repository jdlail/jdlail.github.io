Mashable is getting good with list posts. On Friday there was [this list](https://mashable.com/2007/06/29/keyboard-shortcuts/) of keyboard shortcuts for Web apps. I can never remember those things. And earlier in the week, they did an awesome list of [video tools](https://mashable.com/2007/06/27/video-toolbox/). The video space is moving so quickly, I don't know how long this will be current enough to be useful, but it's an excellent roundup of the present. Now, these are things I find useful.
