[![Ethan Kaplan](/images/ek_snap-thumb-72x72.webp)](https://blackrimglasses.com/)Ethan Kaplan, 28, head of technology at Warner Bros. Records, says his secret dream is to be given a year at the helm of a newspaper to do a groundup reinvention. Now, that would be interesting. He has [some ideas](https://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2007/11/21/spiral-death-watch-newspaper-ads-in-the-can/), including selling the presses!  
  
Some other [smart people](https://www.naa.org/blog/FutureOfNewspapers/index.cfm) have ideas as well on the future of newspapers.
