[![The Subdudes](/subsclrpub01-thumb.jpg)](/subsclrpub01.jpg) There are some albums that just sound like summer. You can just feel the sunny hot summer afternoons or warm summer nights hanging outside with lightin' bugs and crickets. The January 2006 release of the [Subdudes](https://www.subdudes.com/)' "Behind the Leeve" is just one of thsoe really nice summer sounding albums.  There are some albums that just sound like summer. You can just feel the hot summer afternoons and warm summer nights outside with lightin' bugs and cricket sounds. The January 2006 release of the [Subdudes](https://www.subdudes.com/)' "Behind the Leeve" is just one of thsoe really nice summer sounding albums. Give a listen to the first track: "[Dukie & The Mud People](https://www.subdudes.com/audio-visual/papadukie.mp3)." Now crank it up and try to keep from moving. There's a whole [story](https://www.backporchrecords.com/BPartistpick_set.php?thisartist=16) to that song. It's Keb' Mo's first producing effort and I'm a Keb' Mo' fan, too. It's got a Keb feel to it without his vocal sound. The Subdues call their music "New Orleans-flavored Americana." It's a little R&B;, a little country-folk, some Little Feat, melodious accordian, laced in jazz and nice harmonies, I guess New Orleans-flavored Americana gets it. The album was recorded at the Dockside Studios near Lafayette, La. The band members have been playing together on and off since 1987, but they parted ways in 1997 only to reform in 2003. Good idea! I'd love to see them live. They're not booked into Knoxville anytime soon, but do play Kingsport (Twilight Alive) and Asheville (Downtown after Five) in mid-June.
