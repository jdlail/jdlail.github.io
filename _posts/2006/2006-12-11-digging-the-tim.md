Good [move](https://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/10/new-york-times-surrenders-to-social-news/) by the New York Times to add bookmarking links to their stories! On a related topic, Digg is certainly having its trouble with gaming and frnt page manipulation,b ut how long do think it will be before a newspaper adopts a "digg-like" Web site as its primary site?
