_Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances._

The First Amendment Center put out its annual State of the First Amendment report on Thursday.

Some highlights:

* Only 19 percent of Americans think the First Amendment goes too far in the rights it guarantees -- the freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly and petition, a big shift from last year when 38 percent said the First Amendment went too far.

* 70 percent said the media is biased, 15 points higher than last year, but not as high as in 2011 when it reach 76 percent.

* Cameras Always On Dept.: 88 percent believe citizens should be able to record police activity, and 83 percent believe that any footage from police "body cams" should be part of the public record.
