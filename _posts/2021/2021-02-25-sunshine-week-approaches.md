[Sunshine Week](https://www.newsleaders.org/sunshine-week-about) is March 14-20 which highlights and celebrates access to public information and open government.

The best source of information on public records and public access in Tennessee is the [Tennessee Coalition for Open Government](https://tcog.info/) (typically just called "TCOG").

Sunshine Week is a project of the [News Leaders Association](https://www.newsleaders.org/).

There are a lot of issues, including [this one](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/2021/01/04/knox-county-taxpayers-hook-appeal-open-records-case/4097595001/) locally.
