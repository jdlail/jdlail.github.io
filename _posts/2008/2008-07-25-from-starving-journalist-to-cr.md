On [Venture Voice](https://www.venturevoice.com/2008/07/rafat-ali-paidcontent.html) Gregory Galant interviews paidContent.org's Rafat Ali, who talks about blogging from a one-room East London apartment in the early days to the sale of the company to the Guardian for a [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/mediaNews/idUSN1139227820080711?sp=true) $30 million earlier this month.  
  
This is the first of Galant's podcasts in awhile and it's nice to hear a new one.
