> The Internet has changed the economics of the publishing industry in a way commercial television never did. The price of news and information has irrevocably been pushed way down the supply/demand curve. The Web has also destroyed the functional monopoly of the local daily newspaper with the very high barriers to technical entry.

Anyone can be a publisher, and, it seems, these days, most anyone is.

\-- [Forbes](https://forbes.com/home/business/2005/02/22/cx_pm_0222news.html), 2/22/2005 Also, see Forbes article [All The Loyalty That's Fit To Print](https://www.forbes.com/ebusiness/2005/02/23/cx_pp_0223nyt.html), 2/23/2005 "Stopping the Presses" is the pessimistic view (the nightmare of cost-cutting to profitability). But in truth the transition to a new economic model will be bloody .. there's no way around it.

The difficult question raised in the article is: "How serious news organizations will survive when print is in decline but online is not yet generating the revenue to fund expensive newsgathering operations."

I believe -- as someone in the newspaper industry -- we will, however, remake ourselves. And while change we must, the industry's doomsayers might want to remember this quote from Mark Twain: _You cannot depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus._
