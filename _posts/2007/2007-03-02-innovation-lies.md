You might not have seen [this](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/blog/2007/03/02/icm-interview-rob-curley/). Bryan Murley has a new interview with online pioneer and "[Hyper-Local Hero](https://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/110/open_hyper-local-hero.html)" [Rob Curley](https://www.robcurley.com/).

Bryan Murley is online news adviser and on the faculty of the Mass Communication Department at Emory & Henry College and is the webmaster of the [Center for Innovation in College Media](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/).

On being a change agent:

> When people are being brought in to be — and boy is this a terrible term — a “change agent” then the people already in that organization aren’t typically going to react by saying, “Isn’t this great.” The more typical reaction will be that people will be a little mean. Maybe even really mean.
