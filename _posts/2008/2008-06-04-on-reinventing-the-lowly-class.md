[Simon Owens](https://bloggasm.com/reversing-the-advertising-trend-will-newspaper-classifieds-ever-fully-recover) interviews Editor & Publisher columnist Steve Outing on [reinventing classifieds](https://www.reinventingclassifieds.com/) and Scripps alum Christopher Ryan, founder of [Future of News](https://www.futureofnews.com/).  
  
Outing told Simon:  
  
> "... without doing something radical sometime soon, the industry doesn't have much hope."  
>

He also said Craig Newmark and Craigslist is not to blame for the industry woes.
