[![Apple Festival in Erwin, Tenn., Oct. 6, 2006](/applefestival-thumb.jpg)](/applefestival.jpg)  
There were tons of people in [Erwin](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=erwin,+tn&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=6&ll=36.315125,-82.419434&spn=7.928899,21.972656&iwloc=A) today for the [Apple Festival](https://www.unicoicounty.org/apple_festival.html). Lots of "country crafts" and you can basically eat your way from one end of town to the other. I recommend the fired apple pies. The festival continues on Saturday, Oct. 7. Nice fall chill in the air this morning, kind of like a chilled apple, but by mid-day, it was sunny, beautiful and mild. Suppoedly there are 300 booths (I certainly didn't count them) and it attracts 90,000 people.
