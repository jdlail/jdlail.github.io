![Last Year's Model](/images/ps3-sex-box.webp)Anil Dash of Six Apart has a funny new site with a semi-serious purpose: [Last Year's Model](https://lastyearsmodel.org/).  
  
Dash says with all the coverage of what's new, soon to be in released and cutting edge, existing technologies that are less expensive and work get marginalized. I guess that's an attention problem for gadget guys and gals.  
  
"Even alpha geeks often don't run out and buy the newest gadgets and electronics the minute they come out," [he writes on his personal blog.](https://dashes.com/anil/2009/04/sticking-with-last-years-model.html)  
  
So he created a movement "to save the planet through sheer laziness."  
  
The constant hyping of what's new creates the impression that you have to geek-up to keep up.  
  
> It ain't necessarily so. I bounced this idea off of a few tech experts I know, and they all agreed that the constant pursuit of novelty over actual value takes a lot of the joy out of loving great technology. So, to help promote the idea of being thoughtful about what we buy, and how long we hold on to it, I created Last Year's Model, with a design from my friend Mike Monteiro of Mule Design.
