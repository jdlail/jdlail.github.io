Help Knoxville News Sentinel reporter [Lola Alapo](https://twitter.com/lolaalapo "Lola Alapo") in her effort to raise money for [East Tennessee Children's Hospital](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.956192,-83.93824&spn=1.0,1.0&q=35.956192,-83.93824%20%28East%20Tennessee%20Children%27s%20Hospital%29&t=h "East Tennessee Children's Hospital") through "[Star 102.1's 2nd Annual Dancing with the Knoxville Stars](https://www.star1021fm.com/ContestsEvents/DWTKS2010/tabid/6955/Default.aspx) ."  

The fundraiser is drawing to a close and helping Children's Hospital is certainly a worthy cause. Here's an article she wrote about [her effort](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/mar/26/swinging-into-action-for-et-childrens-hospital/).
