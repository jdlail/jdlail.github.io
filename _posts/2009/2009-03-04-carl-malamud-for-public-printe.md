![Cal Malamud](/images/yes-we-scan.webp)I can't think of anyone more qualified in the Digital Age to be the government's head printer than Carl Malamud.  
  
Find out about [his campaign](https://yeswescan.org/) to become the federal government's printer and why that would change America.  
  
Malamud, who was responsible for putting SEC filings online, has more recently has been grabbing huge chunks of governtment records and posting them online.
