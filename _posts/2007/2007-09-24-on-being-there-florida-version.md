![Andrew Meyer, Florida Alligator/AP Photo](/images/andrewmeyerfloridaalligator.webp) Megan Taylor, writing on [News Videographer](https://newsvideographer.com/2007/09/24/tasergate-on-tape/), has an interesting covering-the-coverage piece on last week's Andrew Meyer "Tasergate" story.  
  
Ah, Internet-attention-span-readers, remember back to early last week before Chris Crocker's whole Brittney thing to the University of Florida student Tasered by police during a John Kerry campaign event on campus. OK, here's the [story](https://www.gainesville.com/article/20070921/NEWS/709210337/0/news) which is still big in Gainesville.  
  
Anyway, I found it interesting that even with videos from two different angles, people can't agree on the facts of the incident. Police are tracking down the people that can be identified in the videos as witnesses.
