The podcast "[Just Not Sports](https://justnotsports.com/)" tackles the abuse and harassment women sports writers face in online comments with a video of "regular guy" sports fans reading comments to two women sports journalists.

Here is what a post on the podcast's website [said about the video](https://justnotsports.com/day/2016/04/26/):

> [#MoreThanMean](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23morethanmean&src=typd) hopes to open guys' eyes - by having them open their mouths. The video shows what happens when real sports fans read real online comments made about women sports reporters ... right to their faces.  
>
> In reading the statements out loud to women journalists, guys are forced to experience, sometimes for the first time, the shocking online harassment happening to women in sports day in, day out. It serves as proof most sports fans would NEVER say these things to another person - so we shouldn't type this garbage, either.

Posted April 26, 2016, the video went viral, being seen by 3.15 millions times by Sunday.

Listen to one of the sports journalists in the video, Julie DiCaro, talking about online abuse.
