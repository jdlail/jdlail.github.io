In covering the snowstorm that hit everywhere in Tennessee but Knoxville on Saturday (OK, there was a little on the ground if you didn't blink), I noticed that WKRN in Nashville totally rocked with user submitted photos.  
  
When I surfed through, the site was heralding 70 snowmen photos or over 400 weather pics. In a matter of hours! That is fantastic!  
  
WKRN has a special site to handle the uploaded photos and videos that it calls [Nashflix](https://www.nashflix.com/). Think local YouTube for photos and video. If you go to the bottom of that site's home page, you can see it's powered by a Nashville startup called [Cell Journalist](https://www.celljournalist.com/).  
  
I emailed founder Parker Polidor for the what up. Here's what he said in an emailed response:  
  
> WKRN has been very happy with Nashflix and the response from the community.  I think the total has exceeded 500 images/videos of the recent snow.  It is a great way for people to share the local news and events with others in the same area.  
>
> Recently we added a dynamically updated media badge.  It's a simple javascript that anyone can  include on their blog or website and it pulls in the most recent content.  This can either be the most recent of a particular channel or the most recent content of a particular user.  Its just a great way to push the content from one platform to many other platforms/sites.  
>
> Cell  Journalist is working with other papers/tv stations across the country and more announcements will be made in the next few weeks.  
>
> We are seeing some great interest from smaller papers who want to use our platform to show user AND professional content.  Our platform is well suited to handle both.  
>

If I understand the site correctly, media (photos or video) can be uploaded from a Web browser, by email or from a cell phone. Videos are transcoded into Adobe's Flash format.  
  
These folks seem to have something and WKRN was smart to hook up with them  Best of luck to both.
