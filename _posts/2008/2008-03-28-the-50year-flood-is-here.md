2007 was the worst year for newspaper advertising in 50 years, according to industry trade group, the Newspaper Association of America.

Coverage in [Editor & Publisher](https://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003781895) and [PaidContent](https://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-newspapers-worst-ad-slide-in-50-years/), of which the latter said:_Of course, the industry is getting hit with a double whammy: secular industry shifts, and the effects of a sorry economy, which has decimated core revenue bases like housing, employment and auto ads._
