Maybe it started with a weekend Twitter discussion by [Howard Owens](https://www.thebatavian.com/ "Howard Owens") and [Mathew Ingram](https://www.mathewingram.com/work/about/ "Mathew Ingram") a few weeks ago, but however it began, there's a lively new debate ongoing about Web site comments, particularly on news sites, a topic we've [written about previously](/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=tag%3Dcomments&IncludeBlogs=25&limit=20).  
  
I'm sure the current systems used by most news site that allow for users to have "handles" or "nicknames" or "avatars" could be improved upon..  
  
Here's a thought (fleeting): In addition to real names: add real addresses or current location and display comments on a Google map. Either civility would improve or assaults would rise. It could make for some fascinating looks at the spatial distribution of opinions.
