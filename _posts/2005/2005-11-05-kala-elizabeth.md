Tragedy struck the family of one of my co-workers and friends this week. The _why_ is so unfathomable.

> HAWKINS, KALA ELIZABETH - of Kodak, 13 years of age, the precious daughter of Chris and Tammy Hawkins went home Thursday, November 3rd to be with Jesus after a battle with Leukemia. Kala was a faithful member at Beech Springs Baptist Church. She will be sadly missed by: her parents; her sister, Kara; grandparents, Sam and Joy Hawkins; grandmother, Argile Bozeman; uncles and aunts, Larry and Maureen Cornett, David and Cindy Hawkins, Sammie Hawkins, Mike and Brenda Bozeman, Chris and Debbie Bozeman, Jackie Bozeman, Debbie Sewell, Melody Bozeman; and many cousins. The family greatly acknowledges and appreciates the love and support of friends from the Church, The Knoxville News Sentinel, Northview Middle - Beta Club, Basketball Team, and the Staff of Children's Hospital and the Hematology Clinic. The family will receive friends from 4:00-6:00 pm Saturday, November 5th with the funeral following at Beech Springs Baptist Church of Kodak. Internment, Sunday, 3:00 pm Beech Springs Cemetery. Reverend Wayne Stinnett and Reverend Gary Addington officiating. In lieu of flowers, donations are made to: The B.S.B.Church Building Fund, 337 West Mount Road, Kodak TN 37764; or Children's Hospital Development Dept. PO Box 15010, Knoxville, TN 37901, designate Hemotogly/Onocology Clinic. Atchley Funeral Home, Sevierville, is in charge of arrangements.

I cannot comprehend the grief and sorrow of Kala's parents and sister. I hope this makes a little sense: _"To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die."_ \-- Clyde Campbell She surely will live in the hearts of many. .
