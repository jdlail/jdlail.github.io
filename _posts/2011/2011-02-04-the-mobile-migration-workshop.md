![Save the date](/images/2378160342_ff0ca690a2.webp)If you are developing or executing mobile and tablet strategies for your news organization, reserve April 1, 2011 on your calendar for "The Mobile Migration" workshop in Nashville, Tenn. -- almost a year to the day that [the iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad/ "iPad") went on sale in Apple retail stores.  
  
The Online News Association and the Freedom Forum Diversity Institute are co-sponsoring a one-day workshop at the John Seigenthaler Center on the campus of Vanderbilt University in Nashville that will share real world information about delivering news and information for the small screen.  
  
Speakers include James Moroney III, president and CEO of the [Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/ "The Dallas Morning News"); William J (Bill) Tallent, CEO of app developer [Mercury Intermedia](https://www.mercuryintermedia.com/ "Mercury Intermedia"), which has developed apps for USAToday, the New York Times and others; and [Rex Hammock](https://rexblog.com/ "Rex Hammock") of Hammock Inc., a company that has been recognized for taking using new technology and web-based strategies in the custom media and content marketing industry.  
  
We also will have an international perspective on exploding mobile and tablet markets.  
  
"The Mobile Migration" workshop will cost $50 with discounts for ONA members (435) and students. Special room rates for overnight visitors (the workshop is on a Friday so spend the weekend in Music City) will be available from the Embassy Suites at Vanderbilt in Nashville's West End District.  
  
The workshop is being made possible in part with funding from the Scripps Howard Foundation.
