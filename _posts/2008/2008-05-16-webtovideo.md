HGTV.com's "[Rate My Space](https://ratemyspace.hgtv.com/)" hits cable TV on Sunday, June 8, at 10 p.m. and will regularly be on Thursdays at 9 p.m.  
  
"The success of HGTV.com's Rate My Space page has given the network an incredible opportunity to include our online fan base in our programming," Michael Dingley, senior vice president, HGTV programming said in a news release. "Online visitors have uploaded more than 30,000 room photos to the site, which has generated more than 150 million page views in less than one year. We want to make this appealing, interactive approach to design accessible to all our viewers."  
  
It's not the first time that's happened, but it''s interesting to see the concept make the jump from interactive, user-generated content feature to cable TV show.
