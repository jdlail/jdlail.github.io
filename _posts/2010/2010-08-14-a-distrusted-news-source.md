> With nearly all news organizations struggling to keep up with the up-to-the-minute news cycle and to remain profitable in the process, Americans' low trust in newspapers and television news presents a critical barrier to success. The Pew report asserts that 80% of new media links are to legacy newspapers and broadcast networks, making clear that traditional news sources remain the backbone of the media. But so long as roughly three in four Americans remain distrustful, it will be difficult to attract the large and loyal audiences necessary to boost revenues.

This is the time of the year that newspapers executives around the country gather in off-site meetings to do strategic planning, often utilizing SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis. If you go to these things with any regularity, you will hear that one of the strengths of the news organization is that it is a "trusted news source." But these Gallop numbers say that hasn't been true for years for media in general.  
   
Perception of political media bias doesn't appear to be a big factor in the low-level in the last couple of years, since that's remained much the same since 2003, according to Gallop.  
  
Just another highway sign the media has to be refashioned.
