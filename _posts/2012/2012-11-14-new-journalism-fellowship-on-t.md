**_Fellowship Opp:_**

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, in partnership with the [Associated Press Media Editors](https://www.apme.com), is offering a new one-year journalism fellowship that will focus on the economics of aging and work.  
  
This fellowship is a 12-month residential fellowship located at the headquarters of the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago.  
  
Mid-career journalists working for AP or an APME news organization are eligible to apply.  
  
The topic and the work will be closely connected with the AP-APME special project "Aging America," and the fellow selected will participate in that work.  
  
The fellowship will include the opportunity to produce regular journalism for distribution by AP on issues related to the aging American workforce, to learn the skills of research-based enterprise reporting, to work with economists at the University of Chicago, and to participate in an original NORC survey on retirement planning issues facing the baby boom generation.  
  
While the fellow's reporting will be targeted for a national audience, there will be opportunities to add a local or regional focus. At the end of the year, the fellow will return to the newsroom with skills and experiences designed to elevate not just their own coverage of economic issues but also to share with colleagues.  
  
More information about the fellowship including the online application process is available at [www.apnorc.org](https://www.apnorc.org).  
  
Applications are due Nov. 30.
