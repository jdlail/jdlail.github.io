Interesting take on two people dealt with adversity:  
  
> Yesterday morning, two miles away from my house, a man named Jim Adkisson burst into a church and [started shooting people.](https://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/07/28/church.shooting/index.html)  Today we found out that Mr. Adkisson has not been able to find a job, and that he'd hoped to die in the shooting, too.
>
> Last Friday, another man named [Randy Pausch](https://www.almostgotit.com/2008/03/05/life-is-beautiful-randy-pauschs-inspiring-lecture/) did die, after first inspiring an entire nation with his [positive approach to life](https://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/mostread/s_530835.html)even as he was battling terminal cancer. 

> I do not presume to know why these two men reacted so differently to the adversity they faced.  We *can not know* why some people are so much more resilient than others, nor what battles other people may still be fighting.
