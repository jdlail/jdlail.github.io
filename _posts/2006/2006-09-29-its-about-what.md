I'm sure the American Press Institute Newspaper Next [study](https://www.newspapernext.org/) will be a blueprint for something, but Susan Mernit, a former online newspaper pioneer now with Yahoo Personals, takes the newspaper industry to task for continually redrawing the drawings and says _do something_. Read her [advice](https://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2006/09/newspaper-next-talk-not-action.html). Tags: [newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/newspapers) | [API](https://technorati.com/tag/api) | [Susan Mernit](<https://technorati.com/tag/Susan> Mernit) According to [Paidcontent.org](https://www.paidcontent.org/newspapers-should-push-into-niche-areas-experimental-ventures-study), some of the suggestions in the "Next" report for what newspapers should do include:

* Local information websites and local affiliate sites, such as databases of [upmystreet](https://www.upmystreet.com/)-type info, rateable listings of restaurants and local services and chat groups.  

* Special niche editions for commuters, tourists, parents, seniors, teenagers and entertainment and sports fans.  

* Joint online and print ad sales teams and standardised pricing and delivery for online ads.  

* Think like a disrupter and experiment with a portfolio of ventures, even if that means experimenting with services removed from traditional news.
Sounds reasonable, but:

> "Isn't this report the embodiment of the problem online newspaper businesses face--that there's way more talk than there is action?"

\--Susan Mernit There's a clarion call in here somewhere.
