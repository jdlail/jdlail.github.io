The future of journalism is likely to be small scale and hard news scoops. That is what [AllThingsD's Kara Swisher is thinking](https://kara.allthingsd.com/20090505/kara-visits-hollywood-news-blog-thewrapcom-complete-with-cottage-hq-like-atd/) and she points not only to her highly successful site, but also to that of TheWrap.com, founded by former New York Times and Washington Post reporter Sharon Waxman. [PaidContent.org](https://www.paidcontent.org/) comes to mind as another site in this mold.  
  
I have a hunch she's right. Very lean with tightly focused and highly professional content is where journalism is heading. Waxman called them: "small, nimble, essential news organizations."  
  
Here's a video of Swisher and Waxman discussing journalism and her startup.
