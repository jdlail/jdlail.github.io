Want to know where the next new video innovators will be coming from?

Bryan Murley is keeping [a list](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/blog/2007/09/09/college-newspapers-doing-video/) of college newspasper doing regular online news video. He got quite a few comments on that post.

You got to believe video skills are going to continue to be in demand among online media journalism jobs at newspapers and most of the journalism job openings at newspapers will be in the online areas. Something in the portfolio would be good!
