Where do most people get their news? Not from newspapers it seems. Not even a second! When pollster Zogby did a survey just a couple weeks ago, people said: Where do you get most of your news and information? Internet Sites 39.9% Television 31.5% Newspapers 12.2% Radio. 12.1% Magazines .8% Blogs 1.5% When asked, "Which of the following is your most trusted source for news and information," they said: Internet sites 33.2% Television 21.3% Newspaper 16.0% Radio 14.0% Magazine 2.0% Blogs 1.7% I think this one of the strongest showings by Internet sites vs traditional media that I've seen. See more poll results at JD Lasica' [Social Media site](https://www.socialmedia.biz/), which had an exclusive on this poll, in a PDF [here](https://ia310903.us.archive.org/3/items/ZogbyInternationalZogbyPollonattitudestowardmedia/WeMediaUSadultsXWE.pdf). It has some fascinating data.
