Last night was bloggers night at the Symphony. The symphony in a gambit, I persume, to generate buzz gave bloggers free tickets to the opening night concert at the Tennessee Theatre in downtown Knoxville and they got to go to a special post-concert reception.  
  
I followed it some last night as it was live Twittered. It was historic! It was the first Knoxville event that was live Twittered. These are some I noticed. There may have been others. No, I have no idea what the marmalade is about.

They  call posting  on Twitter micro-blogging. If you're on Twitter, consider [following my Tweets](https://www.twitter.com/jacklail).  
  
And, oh yeah, local bloggers did do a lot of blogging from [their night at the symphony](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=%22knoxville+symphony+orchestra%22&ie=UTF-8&scoring=d).
