Read Write Web on new [Forrester study](https://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_to_reach_baby_boomers_with_social_media.php) (from [@jowyang](https://twitter.com/jowyang)):  
  
> In 2007, the percentage of Boomers consuming social media was 46% for younger Boomers (ages 43 to 52) and 39% for older Boomers (ages 53 to 63). By 2008, those number increased to 67% and 62%, respectively.

> ... Almost one in four younger Boomers (43-52) are active in social networks, up from 15% in 2007.
