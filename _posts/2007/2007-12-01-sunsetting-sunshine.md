Russ McBee sees some [rays of hope](https://russmcbee.com/archive/2007/12/01/bredesen-offers-a-glimmer-of-hope.aspx) in the dimming Sunshine law "reform" that's coming out of Nashville.  
  
My view? Best thing that could happen now is to leave the totally ineffectual,  weak Tennessee Open Meetings law as is cause the reforms are worse.
