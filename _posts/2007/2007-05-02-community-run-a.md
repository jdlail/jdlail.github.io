There are [lessons to be learned](https://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/01/digg-surrenders-to-mob/). It would be interesting to see an analysis of whether the "mass revolt" involved the small percentage of Digg users that consistently push stories to the front page or a wave of dissatisfaction.

I suspect the former although the story spin so far is of a "mass uprising."

Sounds like a successful guerrilla action by the heavily armed influencers. Wonder what Jay Adelson and Kevin Rose would do in an electronic lynching? Oh, what the hell, gimme the rope .... ?
