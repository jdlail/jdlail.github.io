Local blogger Rich Hailey is back in our newsroom observing and live blogging our coverage of the election. See it [here](https://shotsacrossthebow.com/archives/002559.html#002559). It's sort of reminds me of a mirror within a mirror; he's covering how we're covering what we're covering (and now I'm covering his covering ...) and all in near real-time. I hope he enjoys his visit. I don't know how exciting he'll find our newsroom before night's end, but it's certainly a historic election in Tennessee -- and one that has been a focal point for the nation.
