[![Griscom Baker Seigenthaler](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2396/3527485858_5f966bf1c8.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/3527485858/ "Griscom Baker Seigenthaler by jacklail, on Flickr") Chattanooga Times Free Press editor Tom Griscom, former U.S. Senator Howard Baker Jr. and Freedom Forum founder and retired Gannett exeecutive John Seigenthaler at the East Tennessee History Center. Griscom and Seigenthaler had a public conversation Tuesday night on the press and journalism.  
   
Cynthia Moxley [has a report](https://bluestreak.moxleycarmichael.com/index.php/2009/05/veteran-journalists-profession-at-precipice/) that includes this quote from Baker, whose daughter Cissy, is a news executive with the Tribune Co.:  
  


> "We can't do without news. We have to be informed. Must you be outrageous to make money? As with most things in life, the extremes are what sink us. What will happen next?"  
> 

Baker's comment came during the question period, but he also introduced the two journalists.
