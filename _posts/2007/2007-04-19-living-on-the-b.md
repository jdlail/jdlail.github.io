We launched the Associated Press beta video player yesterday on knoxnews.com that adds a "local channel" of video content. We've been in the AP video network for a year or more, but the ability to upload our own content into the player is new. [Take a look](https://beta.video.syndication.msn.com/v/Legacy.aspx?g=bad04bcd-443d-4bee-a918-906f81fa85fb&f=tnknn&fg=copy). It's got a pretty easy to use admin tool, delivers video in both Windows Media and Flash formats, works with _at least_ Internet Explorer and Firefox, and the Windows and OS X operating systems. You can email links and create your own playlist. The Associated Press, working with Microsoft and some other vendors/partners, has some ambitious growth plans for the online video network. We'll see where it goes. Tags: [video](https://technorati.com/tag/video) | [AP](https://technorati.com/tag/ap) | [Associated Press](<https://technorati.com/tag/associated> press)
