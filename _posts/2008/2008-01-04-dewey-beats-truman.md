[![DeweyTruman.jpg](/images/DeweyTruman-thumb-200x146.webp)](/images/DeweyTruman.webp)How to cover an election in 2008:  
  
* Mark Glaser: [Iowa Caucuses Blanketed by Twitter, Blogs, Video](https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2008/01/the_net_effectiowa_caucuses_bl.html)
* Mark 'Rizzn' Hopkins: [Huckabama Wins, a Few Observations](https://mashable.com/2008/01/03/iowa-caucus-results/)
* Instapundit: [Like Twitter, but longer](https://instapundit.com/archives2/2007/12/30-week/) (sometimes).

There were some some Dewey-Truman print headlines in 2000. Probably won't matter in 2008.
