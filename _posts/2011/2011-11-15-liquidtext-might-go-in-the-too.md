Craig Tashman, a doctorate student in the School of Interactive Computing, says this research project at Georgia Tech is being spun out of the university and will become a startup. [LiquidText](https://liquidtext.net/) will be first released as an iPad app. It's a tool that could have implications for journalists.  
  
The plan is to make it work with PDF documents (it only works with text files right now), standard issue for much government information. The ability to easily and graphically selected noted sections and relate them could be a powerful tool.  
  
I don't think I've seen anything quite like it. It was one of the things I stumbled upon at FutureMedia Fest 2011 at George Tech.
