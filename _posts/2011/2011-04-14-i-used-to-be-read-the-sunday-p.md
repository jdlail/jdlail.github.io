Bill Tallent, CEO of Mercury Intermedia, which developed the iPad app of USA Today and apps for other media companies, speaks at "The Mobile Migration Workshop" in Nashville, Tenn., on April, 1, 2011. Tallent says the iPad has the potential to replace the Sunday paper and already appears to be "the device" for news.  
  
Great data on the smartphone, the iPad and the tablet market in his talk..
