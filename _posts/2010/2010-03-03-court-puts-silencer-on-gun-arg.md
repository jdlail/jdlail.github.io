The media group Radio Television Digital News Association ([RTDNA](https://www.rtdna.org/)) expressed disappointment today that the Supreme Court refused to release same day audio tapes in the key Second Amendment case before the court yesterday.  
  
"The Supreme Court is the ultimate people's court, and people have the right to hear and see what goes on there. It's disappointing that the news media are not allowed to use their best tools to deliver this important story to their audiences," said RTDNA Chairman Stacey Woelfel in a news release.  
  
During oral arguments before the justices Tuesday in the key gun issue case, the Supreme Court signaled it will strike down outright bans on handguns by cities or other local governments, a groundbreaking ruling if handed down this summer. The court, however, could allow some limitations to the Second Amendment's "right to keep and bear arms."  
  
RTDNA noted that audio tapes of oral arguments were released the same day in a similar 2008 case to the _[McDonald v. Chicago](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/mar/03/justices-may-extend-gun-owner-rights-nationwide/?partner=popular)_ case heard on Tuesday and that same day release had been fairly common on big cases since the 2000 _Bush v. Gore_ case.  
  
The court, however, turned down a request by broadcasters for same day audio on Tuesday.
