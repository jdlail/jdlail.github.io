[![Knoxville News Sentinel building at 2332 News Sentinel Drive, Knoxville, TN](/images/ve_knoxvillenewsentinel.webp)](https://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=pztvjs803tmz&style=o&lvl=1&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=20255450&encType=1)William Hartnett, a reporter at the Palm Beach Post, features the Knoxville News Sentinel in his [Paper View Monday](https://www.wmhartnett.com/category/newspaper-buildings/) series of aerial views of newspaper plants.  
  
Hartnett [says](https://www.wmhartnett.com/2007/12/24/paper-view-monday-knoxville-news-sentinel/) the aerial shot (or bird's eye view as Microsoft calls it) of the News Sentinel building was just added in the [last few days](https://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%2110177.entry) to Microsoft's Virtual Earth/Live Maps service. Looks like the Microsoft team did a big dump of Knoxville images. The News Sentinel has been in this building since 2002, but finding its address (2332 News Sentinel Drive) is still a bit spotty with online map services so this is pretty good. I think I see my car!  
  
Zoomable version of the shot is [here](https://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=pztvjs803tmz&style=o&lvl=1&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=20255450&encType=1).  
  
Thanks, Will, for the Christmas Eve present! I enjoy your Paper View Monday blogging.
