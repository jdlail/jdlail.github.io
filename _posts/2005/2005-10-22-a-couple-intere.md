[I've been playing with "[Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com). It's a simple site concept. It just does "To Dos." No feature bloat. It's got a single purpose in life -- so far.  I've never been a list maker.Maybe Post-It reminders and scribbled scraps of paper in the cipher I call handwriting, but that's about it. Would this make me a list maker?. We'll see. It's definitely more fun -- and mobile for me -- than Outlook's "tasks." To Dos can be color-coded by priority, grouped by topic and can tickle your e-mail, cell phone or IM. You can also add To Dos via an e-mail template. Pretty good for a site created by a girl, a guy and a monkey. See [the team](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/about/team.rtm). Try it. It does help you focus on getting things done.. Another interesting I've looked at this week is [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com). If you've ever been in a press release that made it onto the Internet, you're probably on here. I wouldn't want to rely on it, but as a first cut tool to find out about someone, it's sort of decent, particularly if they have an uncommon name. ZoomInfo is combing a lot of Web resources to built it's database. Note to job seekers: Your next prospective employer could be looking here.
