[![teachingcatfetch.jpg](/images/teachingcatfetch-thumb-175x149.webp)](/images/teachingcatfetch.webp)Melissa Worden has a [nice post on the Multimedia News Producers Workshop](https://www.melissaworden.com/blogs/xdegree/2007/08/mnpw-how-to-teach-a-cat-to-fetch-or-training-your-newsroom/) in Minneapolis.  
  
Someone put together a funny video about newsroom training being similar to training cats to fetch. Since herding them didn't work, maybe teaching them to fetch will? I have to agree that training about "that Internet" is a lot of like teaching cats to fetch. We had a senior editor bail out of a training session last week after five minutes. _(sigh)_  
  
Worden makes the point that we have to figure out how to make training fun like [Kate McGinty](https://www.postcrescent.com/includes/newspaper/blogs/reel/2007/08/p-c-reporter-takes-multimedia-plunge.html) taking the multimedia plunge. But watch the [training cats video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3oyg8p0nMo) It's great.  
  
She also posted this great guide that was presented at the workshop on rating video stories and the time they can consume. I need to circulate this one around my newsroom.  
  
> >> One star: Raw video, recorded for no more than 45 seconds. The final product has no editing or titles. Production time: 1-2 hours, which includes shooting, ingestion, formatting and posting.  
>

> >> Two star: Very rough cut video. Two to four cuts in a short video with limited titles. Production time: 2-4 hours, which includes shooting, ingestion, formatting and posting.  
>

> >> Three star: Project is shot, edited and posted the same day. Includes 1-3 brief interviews (A roll) with other shots (B roll). Titles are used as intro and to introduce people. Production time: 4-6 hours, which includes shooting, ingestion, formatting and posting.  
>

> >> Four star: Often supplements in-depth enterprise stories. Video may contain several interviews and voiceovers or on-camera reporter interviews. Production time: May take several days to complete, which includes shooting, ingestion, formatting and posting.
