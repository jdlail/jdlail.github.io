Advertiing Age has done online video study covering viewing habits this year:  
  
During the first half of 2007:  
  
* 62% of consumers viewed news clips
* 38% viewed movie trailers
* 36% viewed music videos (sharply down from 2006).

But here's the wake-up-and-smell-the-coffee number: Nearly 70 percent of people age 35 and older are watching online video.
