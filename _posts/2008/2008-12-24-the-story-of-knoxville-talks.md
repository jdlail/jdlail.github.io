Katie Allison Granju on [newsroom blogging](https://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=100712) and how she came to create Knoxville Talks.  
  
> Far too many publishers, reporters, editors, anchors and producers still see blogging as some sort of second-class, redheaded stepchild. Bloggers aren't real journalists, so the argument goes, and they certainly don't belong in the newsroom. But as real journalists and journalism professors continue to grapple with what exactly it is they do these days, bloggers are out there just doing it--without the angsty navel-gazing or handwringing. Bloggers certainly can be real journalists, albeit ones who fall into their own category within the profession. The sooner the powers that be accept this new reality, the sooner they can begin reaping the benefits.

That's part of a Nieman Reports article on how an innovation came about in one newsroom. Good reading.
