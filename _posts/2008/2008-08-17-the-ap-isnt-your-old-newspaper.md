[Jason Preston](https://eatsleeppublish.com/in-ten-years-newspapers-will-be-selling-their-content-to-the-ap/):  
  
> The AP is poised to flip the age-old relationship of content provider and distributor. Inside ten years, the AP will control the distribution path to the largest possible audience, and will be offering member papers a kickback on all ads served against its articles.

> Papers would be insane not to take that deal.
