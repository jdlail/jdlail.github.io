Technology won't save newspapers, but telling a good story might. Gary Goldhammer in his Below the Fold blog [says](https://belowthefold.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/01/social_media_to.html) newspapers have been revamped and "Tivoed" to appeal to our "cultural Attention Deficit Disorder" so that we get snippets instead of nuggets.

I agree with Goldhammer that tools don't create the substance. But learning to _tell the story_ in video or audio or flash or whatever is next does make good journalism. A medium that allows video and interactive story telling demands its use. Our early efforts [KnoxNews.com](https://www.knoxnews.com/) at news Web video and audio often find the multimedia piece -- especially video -- will get greater traffic than the same's reporter's text piece. The trick, as Goldhammer notes, is that the technology be used to _tell the story_. For newspaper journalists, we're still learning to do that one in the digital world as well as it can be done with print. It's about doing journalism.
