Grant Moise, digital general manager of the [Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/ "The Dallas Morning News"), says the  realization by his company that its digital stratgies had no vilable business model  led to its current efforts with premium content, tablet apps and new digital products. Moise talked about the closed watched strategies unfolding in Dallas at "The Mobile Migration Workshop" on April 1, 2011 in Nashville.  
  
In this video of his presentation, Moise does a deep dive to the efforts underway and planned in Dallas.  
  
Moise is currently the Digital General Manager at The Dallas Morning News where he oversees all aspects of digital initiatives. All Editorial and Sales departments report to Moise and he is also responsible for Product Development.  
  
Over his time leading this group, Moise has overseen the shift to a digital premium content model as well as the development of new iPhone and iPad apps which launched in the market in January of 2011. He is also currently the Publisher of Briefing which is a free print publication The Dallas Morning News launched in August of 2008 and is a 203,000 circulation newspaper in the greater Dallas area.  
  
Prior to this role, Moise was the Vice President of Direct Channel Sales for Tribune Media Net (now known as Tribune 365). Tribune 365 is a national sales organization that represents Tribune newspapers and web sites for advertisers who advertise across multiple Tribune properties. In his role at Tribune he oversaw all advertising that came through traditional media buying channels which included direct business or advertising bought through full service advertising agencies.  
  
Back in 2004, Moise was at The Dallas Morning News where he managed a New Business Development Team and was also a Retail and National Sales Director. Before Moise worked on the publishing side of the business, he was an Account Executive with KCNC-TV (CBS affiliate) in Denver, Colorado. He is also very active in the Advertising industry as he recently completed his term as President of the Dallas Ad League which is the 3rd largest advertising league in the country.  
  
In addition to the time spent in the industry, Moise currently sits on the Board of Directors for the NB3 Foundation which is a foundation dedicated to improving childhood obesity for Native Americans. Moise is originally from Albuquerque, New Mexico and the Native American people have played a very significant role in his life and this foundation is a way for him to give back to this meaningful community.  
  
Moise is a graduate of the William Allen White School of Journalism at the University of Kansas and also has an MBA from Texas Christian University.  
  
The workshop was co-sponsored by the [Online News Association](https://www.jouranlists.org/) and the [Freedom Forum Diversity Institute](https://freedomforumdiversity.org/).
