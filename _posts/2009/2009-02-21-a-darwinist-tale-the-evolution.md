[![Gutenberg Press](/assets-c/2009/02/gutenberg-press-thumb-150x124-434.webp)](/images/gutenberg-press.webp)It's nice to see Jay Small blogging more.

He suggests a combination of digital printing, customization and frequency changes might be the adaptations that bring new life to the ancestral line of the [Gutenberg press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press).
