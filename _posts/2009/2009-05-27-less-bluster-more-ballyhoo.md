[![Mme. Clofullia](/assets_c/2009/05/josephine7ow-735892-thumb-150x224-468.webp)](/images/josephine7ow-735892.webp)Buzzmachine Jeff Jarvis often asks "What Would Google Do?" to outline a digital strategy, but maybe the question media companies need to ask is "What would P.T. Barnum Do?"  
  
Tom Grubisich urges newspapers to [leverage their Google links](https://www.ojr.org/ojr/people/TomEditor/200905/1737/) to the gaudy max instead of lamenting about the search giant.  
  
> To be blunt, what newspapers have to do is emulate the marketing savvy of the carnival. When you came to the freak show, you were greeted by spectacularly clothed, fast-talking barker. Standing next to the barker was the "bearded lady" or "wild man of Borneo" or some other bizarre creature - a tantalizing sampling of what was insidethe tent. Buy a ticket for 50 cents, and you could satisfy your socially incorrect curiosity.

All we have to do is get them into the tent.
