!['Big Pete' Ramagos, rigger at work on dam \(TVA\) Douglas Dam, Tenn., in June 1942](/images/2179060841_96e8334178.webp)  
I've been reading about flickr and the Library of Congress' [Commons Project](https://flickr.com/commons) and decided to take a look and see if there were any photos from [Tennessee](https://www.flickr.com/search/?w=8623220%40N02&q=tennessee&m=text). There are. The photo above was taken in June 1942 at Douglas Dam of "Big Pete" Ramagos, a rigger.  
  
There are several of Douglas Dam's construction, copper mining near Ducktown, Watts Bar Dam, various other TVA facilities. a corn field by a river in northeast Tennessee, and work on the "Vengeance" dive bomber at a Nashville plant. I wish there were more.  
  
Rex Hammock [writes](https://www.hammock.com/craft/2008/01/a_new_way_to_discover_hidden_n.php) about some of the details of the project and has some links to more info. This is a wonderful way of unlocking the rich-with-history collection of public domain photos at the Library of Congress. The flickr folks [blog about it](https://blog.flickr.com/en/2008/01/17/wow/).
