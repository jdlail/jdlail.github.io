Michael Rosenblum on newspapers and video:  
  
> Q: Are there any newspapers out there you think are doing this right?

> A: No. None. There are some that are getting closer, but we are in uncharted waters and have a chance not only to do this right, but also to become the Gold Standard for the entire industry.  That is why the stuff has to be just so excellent.
