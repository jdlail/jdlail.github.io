The Inland Press Association presented its New Frontier Awards during its annual meeting in San Antonio earlier this week and [knoxnews](https://www.knoxnews.com/) won a top "General Excellence" award.  
  
The judges said:  
  
> The Knoxville site is everything you want a news site to be: It's smartly reported, deeply local, and amazingly agile. There's an immediacy about the site that shows up just about everywhere, from text alerts to video that comes straight off the news to a river of headlines. The site is executing well across many different types of content and engagement -- Video and photos, breaking news, blogs and user interaction.  
>
> The importance of programming -- or, at minimum, thinking like a programmer -- is a skill every journalist needs. And this site displays that mindset well. The user interface is beautiful, and the producers are fearless in changing presentation to match the biggest news of the day. Every local news site should serve its audience so well
