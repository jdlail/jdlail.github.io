\-- [Jakob Nielsen](https://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040913.html) I saw this in Leslie Walker's ".Com" [column](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/31/AR2006053102190.html) today (6/1/2006) in The Washington Post about Nielsen's latest book, _[Prioritizing Web Usability](https://www.useit.com/prioritizing/)_. The quote turned up as early as his September 13, 2004, [newsletter](https://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040913.html) and is still apt. Walker also uses a great term: **screensucker** (wasting time in front of any screen) which she credits to Edward Hallowell in his _[CrazyBusy: Overstretched, Overbooked and About to Snap! Strategies for Coping in a World Gone ADD](https://www.drhallowell.com/store/crazybusy.html)._ The title of that was so long, I was off screensucking elsewhere.
