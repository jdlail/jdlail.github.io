A great piece from Om Malik on media. There's lot of food for thought [in this piece](https://om.co/2014/05/06/festivus-journalism-perugia/).

Among his highlights:

> * No one could've predicted FB and Twitter as the boosters for media and this is why we've seen so much change and new models.
> * The problem with media is that it's trying to find a answer within itself and not looking at what readers want.
> * The internet as we know it is at an end. The Chinese and Brazilian internets are developing in their own way and pace.
> * Putting a paywall on a thing people were getting for free is a backward move. You must create a new, compelling, useful experience.
> * My open source tools are a paper and a pen.
> * Journalism schools need to teach journalism for the social media age.
> * Big publishers are in the habit of always 'taking' from users, not giving back.
> * We are limited by the industrial definition/model of journalism.
> * It is time for big publications to think of themselves as technology platforms.
