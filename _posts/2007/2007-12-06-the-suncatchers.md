[![Sausage](/images/blog/sausage-thumb-150x112.webp)](https://www.ntscblog.com/2008/12/sausage-is-better-than-politics.html)Joe Lance of "the pulse" in Chattanooga has a [good opinion piece](https://www.chattanoogapulse.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2007/12/05/4755c20c5ccae) on the Sunshine law "reform" called "A Quorum, a Forum, or a Threesum?"  
  
Lance is one of many disturbed by a state legislative committee's Sunshine Sausage.

Michael Silence has been doing yeomen's effort of trying to keep up with what's being said statewide by bloggers and others. Below is a list of links including Silence's coverage  that are drawn from Knoxville Blog Network's [feed search and widget tool](https://blognetwork.knoxnews.com/feedcentral.php). Since the link lists are javascripts, they won't show up for RSS readers; you'll need to click through to this post.  
  
Other voices are weighing in [across the state](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=tennessee+open+meetings).
