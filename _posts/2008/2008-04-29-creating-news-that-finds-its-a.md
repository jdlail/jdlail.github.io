An insider who's now an outsider has insider [advice](https://www.melissaworden.com/blogs/xdegree/2008/04/looking-from-the-outside-in/) on outsiders for insiders running news sites.  
  
Now I've got you as confused as Lou Costello in "[Who's on First](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/humor4.shtml)"?  
  
Well, as Bud Abbott said: "I say Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third."  
  
I'm glad that's clear; Because is in centerfield.  
  
In a much more lucid piece, I think former newspaper New Media journalist Melissa Worden says we haven't figured out for her that new buzz phrase:: "[If the news is that important, it will find me](https://www.ketterick.com/dan/blog/?p=134)." (And as a phrase, It's quite the [rage](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=%22If+the+news+is+that+important%2C+it+will+find+me%22&btnG=Search+Blogs).)  
  
Or as media consultant Terry Heaton [says](https://www.thepomoblog.com/archive/finding-news-consumers-the-new-mission-of-media/): "You can't 'find' anybody by insisting them come to you."  
  
It's a concept we need to get faster than Costello learned the names of the players on his new baseball team..  
  
Worden has some great observations on how her news habits have changed and some suggestions on how news can find her. What are some more?  
  
_And best of luck, Melissa, in your HSN gig!_
