In case you're wondering, we are past the tipping point ...

> In the U.S., between 2000 and 2005, around 18% of all broadband households terminated their newspaper subscriptions.

> Early U.S. data through the first three quarters of 2006 suggest that, by 2010, 35% of all broadband households will have terminated their newspaper subscriptions.

That's from a new report by William Bird, a market-moving analyst for Citigroup. See coverage in [Business Week](https://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8LM6DCG0.htm), [Barron's Tech Trader Daily](https://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2006/11/29/apparently-the-internet-really-is-killing-the-newspaper-industry/) and [The Houston Chronicle](https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/steffy/4370813.html). Not even the trends he finds that ought to be positive for print circulation are helping: the fastest gorwing age group is 55-plus and the slowing rates of broadband adotption (because the percentage already is high).

> The only conclusion we can draw from these data is that the pace of Internet substitution is accelerating so fast that it is overwhelming two positive underlying trends: older demographics and slowing broadband adoption.

The changing economics and demographics could mean newspapers as a category won't see bottom line growth for five years. Tags: [newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/newspapers) | [broadband](https://technorati.com/tag/broadband) | [William Bird](https://technorati.com/tag/william+bird)
