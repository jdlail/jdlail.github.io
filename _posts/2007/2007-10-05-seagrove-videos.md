I found several excellent videos on some of the potters I know in Seagrove, NC. We've bought several (as in lots) of pieces of Terry and Anna King and their daughter, Crystal. Terry King, who I went to high school with one year, also talks a bit about my favorite Seagrove potters, Dorothy and Walter Auman, who made our wedding china. You need to go yourself!  
  
The videos were done by [Dan McCoig](https://www.dantraveling.com/). He's got lots more videos from the Southeast. I noticed several out of Great Smoky Mountains and East Tennessee.  
   
Hey Dan, I like that Knoxville cap. I'll send you a knoxnews.com cap if you want one!
