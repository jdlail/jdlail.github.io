I wonder if my headline is direct enough?  
  
If you have a minute, join the new Facebook group that co-worker [Lauren Spuhler](https://www.laurenspuhler.com/) created called "[Songs of Appalachia](https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8589839867)."  
  
She describes it:  
  
> "Songs of Appalachia" is a monthly video series featuring musicians from East Tennessee who help define the music of this region. It is published on knoxnews.com and is more than just country music.  
>
> The music may be classified as "home-grown" or "old-timey" and has deep roots to Africa, Scotland, Ireland and England. It is a mixture of fiddle, banjo, mandolin and guitar, incorporating jigs, reels, polkas, country and bluegrass.  
>
> Join online producer/videographer Lauren Spuhler and News Sentinel staff writer Morgan Simmons as they explore the musical roots of our region.  
>

Anyway, join her group to keep up with this interesting project. If you're into mountain roots or even ruts, it's a must.
