I was playing with Google's [SMS feature](https://www.google.com/sms/index.html). You can search yellow pages, residential listings, weather, movie times and definitions simply by entering some text and sending a text message to 46645. It works really fast -- and well.

Granted, a more generic definition of parse (to analyze) might have been better. There's been a lot of talk of sending headlines and info to users based on profile information they filled out, but I have never found that very useful. Other than talking to other people, SEARCH via SMS seems like a killer app. Try it! I used Google SMS via a Palm and a bluetooth enabled cell phone using [FunSMS](https://www.fun4palm.com/x4/index.asp), which made it easy to do queries and get results (and save them).
