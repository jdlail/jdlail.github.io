This has been a bit under the radar, but a lot of work has been going on with the [E.W. Scripps](https://www.scripps.com/) Digital Division, in which I now work, since early last fall. You'll be hearing more as a lot of projects and initiatives are in the pipeline. Stay tuned, there are some exciting things in the works.  
  
For me at a newspaper, itt's been fun having more contact with our TV station digital folks and being part of a newly created division with a bevy of bold new ideas. On the downside, a lot of talented Scripps digital foks based in the News Sentinel building in Knoxville and who were with what was known as the Scripps Interactive Newspaper Group did not to move to Cincinnati.
