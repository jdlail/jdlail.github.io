[Why journalists should use Twitter (Nico Luchsinger)](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2008/01/18/why-journalists-should-use-twitter/)  
  
If you haven't "gotten" Twitter yet as a journalist, this might help. But I've found only using it for awhile really explains it. It's that game-changing.  
  
If you don't know,  at knoxnews, we [funnel local news headlines into Twitter](https://twitter.com/knoxnews). Not a bad place to start exploring it.  
  
(via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacklail), of course, and "follow" me)
