[![Zadi Diaz](/images/385064456_e6c93bd6c6-thumb.webp)](/images/385064456_e6c93bd6c6.webp)Zadi Diaz has become one of my favorite vbloggers. When I was doing the viral thing, one of my co-workers said: "She's no Ze Frank." Ah, no, she's not. She's executive producer and host of JETSET and a lover of chocolate and raspberry (more [bio](https://zadidiaz.com/blog/about/)). I don't think I would ever mistake her for Ze Frank. Yesterday, the 50th episode of Diaz and Steve Woolf's vblog, JETSET, was [posted](https://jetsetshow.com/2007/04/50th_episode_back_to_videoblog.html). JETSET, which Diaz calls a Vloggie, is described as an Internet and pop culture show for young adults (that's not me, but I like it anyway). The first episode were online on [June 1, 2006](https://jetsetshow.com/2006/06/whats_a_videoblog.html). And Zadi Diaz is on the verge of being of a big Internet video star. Maybe she already is. In the 50th episode, she gave shoutouts to a whole gang of other video bloggers (she must have just spaced [The Randoms](https://www.knoxnews.com/randomthis)). Browse around the site and watch some other episodes. Best of luck to Diaz and Woolf in their [WebbyAward nomination](https://pv.webbyawards.com/account/login). Look likes a slam dunk in their category. Earlier this week, Diaz was at the Radio Television News Directors Association big confab in Vegas and talked about what she's doing in this [video clip](https://dayzwn.nojo.cz/2007/04/17/rtnda-vlog-talk/). Here's Lost Remote's [coverage](https://www.lostremote.com/2007/04/15/rtnda-opening-session-gets-all-web-20/) of the same panel she was on. Beyond JETSET, Diaz has a [text blog](https://www.zadidiaz.com/Zadi%20Diaz.html) and is on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/Zadi) Photo on right is from her [Flickr stream](https://www.flickr.com/photos/karmagrrrl/). And there's Terry Heaton [getting his photo taken](https://www.thepomoblog.com/archive/rtnda-welcomes-the-new-world/) with Diaz and Amanda Congden. How'd that happen -- and in Vegas?
