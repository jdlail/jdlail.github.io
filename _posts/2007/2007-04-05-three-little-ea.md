It's almost Easter, but not many newspapers executives will think of Dave Morgan as the Easter Bunny with his latest colorful [present](https://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=58245) on the Online Spin blog. But if newspapers were willing to forget who they were, they might win the future egg hunt by adopting or adapting his three suggestions. An example: Abandon print/online integration.

> Forcing them together only serves to slow down the immediacy with which the print side will confront its decline and guarantees that the digital side will never be a viable long-term competitor for the hearts, minds and pocketbooks of local audiences and advertisers.

I think that is one egg for the basket. Read his others and see if you think they go in the Easter basket as well. Tags: [media](https://technorati.com/tag/media) | [newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/newspapers)
