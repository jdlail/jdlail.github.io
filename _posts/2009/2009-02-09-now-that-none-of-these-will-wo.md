Jeff Jarvis buzzsaws through the [recent spate of models of journalism](https://www.buzzmachine.com/2009/02/09/can-journalism-go-with-the-flow/) that just won't work.  
  
Well, really business models for newspapers that he sees just won't work. They are in order:  
  
* Paid content
* Antitrust exemptions
* Micropayments
* Make Google pay
* Charity
* Government bailout
* Positive PR spin

Meanwhile [TV stations are being advised](https://www.lostremote.com/2009/02/05/how-local-tv-sites-can-take-advantage-of-newspapers/) to prepare for the day newspapers are outta here. But Jarvis does says, [there may be solutions](https://newsinnovation.com/).
