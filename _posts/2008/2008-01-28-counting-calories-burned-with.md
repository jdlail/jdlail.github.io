My Sunday afternoon jogging music was a good one from 2004, "Films About Ghosts (The Best Of Counting Crows)."  
  
I notice the band is offering a free "Digital 45" on its [Web site](https://countingcrows.com/). The MP3s are time stamped Jan. 11. The two "sides" are "When I Dream of Michelanglo" and "1492." They are from the coming March 2 release of the album "Saturday Nights & Sunday Morings."_Get 'em._  
  
Anyway, a track listing for "Films About Ghosts."  
  
  1. Angels Of The Silences 3:38
  2. Round Here 5:31
  3. Rain King 4:15
  4. A Long December 4:57
  5. Hanginaround 4:14
  6. Mrs. Potters Lullaby 7:45
  7. Mr. Jones 4:32

It was a pretty decent week exercising. Wish I had done one more session.
