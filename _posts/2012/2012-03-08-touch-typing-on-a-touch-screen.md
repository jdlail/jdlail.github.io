A touch screen app for the visually impaired. That's ingenious Georgia Tech.  
  
The info:  
  
A team from Georgia Tech, led by Post Doctorate Fellow Mario Romero (School of Interactive Computing) has designed [BrailleTouch](https://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?nid=110051) for touchscreen mobile devices. The prototype app allows visually impaired people to easily type and opens the door for everyone to text or type without looking at the screen.
