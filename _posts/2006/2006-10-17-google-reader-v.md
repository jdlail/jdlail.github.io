I think I'm making the switch from [Bloglines](https://my.bloglines.com/) to [Google Reader](https://reader.google.com/) for RSS feeds. Been using the Google one for a few days and I like it. It was pretty much a snap to export my Bloglines list of blogs as an OPML file and import them into the Google Reader. What you think? Which one is better? What's your fav?
