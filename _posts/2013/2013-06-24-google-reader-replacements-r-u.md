Google announced a couple months ago it was discontinuing, or "[retiring](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html)," Google Reader on July 1.

Google's decision seems to have created an opportunity for others.

Recent reports have [Digg](https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/06/inside_digg_reader/all/), [AOL](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/06/24/aol-reader/), and [Facebook](https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/23/4457966/facebook-working-on-news-reader-app-wsj) working on Reader replacements. And there are others announcing or [beefing up offerings](https://cloud.feedly.com/#welcome).

Meanwhile, Nick Bradbury, who has joined [Automatic](https://nickbradbury.com/2013/05/18/i-joined-automattic/) (makers of WordPress), has released the final verson of the venerable [FeedDemon](https://nickbradbury.com/2013/06/20/the-last-version-of-feeddemon-is-here-and-its-free/) and made it free.

Have you found something to replace Google Reader yet? Or, maybe the question is, do you need a replaceemnt for Reader?
