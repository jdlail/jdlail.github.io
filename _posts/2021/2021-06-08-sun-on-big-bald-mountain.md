Here is a photo of Big Bald, part of the Bald Mountains as seen from the Wolf Laurel Country Club in June 2021.

Never heard of Big Bald?

It's between Erwin, Tennessee, and Mars Hill, North Carolina, off Interstate-26.

The Appalachian Trail and the Tennessee/North Carolina line cross the mountain, which at an elevation of 5,516 feet is the tenth highest peak on the 2,190-mile hiking trail.

There are technically two balds there, Big Bald and Big Stamp.

Because it's a bald, there are spectacular views on clear days but it can often be shrouded in fog and clouds.

Here are some videos from over the years shot from atop the bald.
