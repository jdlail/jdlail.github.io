Rex Hammock notes that AT&T;, the telephone company formerly known as BellSouth in these parts, is offering an unadvertised $10 DSL rate as part of a government settlement. AN AP story from late yesterday says:

> The DSL, or digital subscriber line, plan introduced Saturday is part of the concessions made by AT&T to the Federal Communications Commission to get its $86 billion acquisition of BellSouth Corp. approved last December.
