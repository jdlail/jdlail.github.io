> "It just seems impossible to me that you're cutting costs dramatically without having some impact on the editorial quality of your product," said Peter Appert, a newspaper analyst at Goldman Sachs. "I can't prove that this is driving circulation, but it's certainly something that if I were a newspaper publisher would keep me up at night."

That's from a [New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/business/media/28circ.html?_r=2&ref=business&oref=slogin&oref=slogin) on declining print circulation figures for newspapers. The thread between newsroom reductions and circulation declines may be tenuous. For example print circulation was declining at a slower pace even while newsrooms were _growing_. But it's an interesting thought as seen in this [Ken Doctor piece](https://www.contentbridges.com/2008/10/slaughtering-the-cash-cows-a-bit-too-early.html).  
  
But there's reasons aplenty beyond newspaper subscribers turn out not to be an annuity to keep a publisher sleepless these days.
