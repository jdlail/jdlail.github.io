I was still listening to Michael Franti last week, but this time "[Songs From the Front Porch: An Acoustic Collection](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=Michael%20Franti%20Songs%20from%20the%20Front%20Porch&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&index=blended&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=ur2&o=1)" and also Michael Powers [Prodigal Son](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=B000HT2M5K&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&index=blended&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=ur2&o=1). _peace to the people who be losin' their head peace to the people who be needin' a bed love to the people who be feelin' alone spreadin' love upon the microphone hope to the people to be feelin' down smile to the people who be wearin' a frown faith to the people who be seekin' the truth y'all_ \-- "Sometimes," Michael Franti
