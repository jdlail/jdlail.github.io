_Hardly!_ There is a lot of concern -- read opposition in many corners -- to a plan by AOL and Yahoo to charge marketers who send bulk emails, be it special offers from L.L. Bean, Target or Buy.com that you might have asked for ... or all those you didn't want to get.  For a quick look at the issue, see this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/2006/02/06/email-aol-yahoo_cx_ck_0206spam.html). But these moves by Yahoo and AOL probably will impact legit emailers more than spammers. The spammers, of course, will figure a way around it before it's implemented; the legit emailers will see their cost of doing business rise and the consumer will wonder why their box is crammed with junk mail. Not the end of e-mail, but hardly progress. _Update:_ An Electronic Frontier Foundation [piece](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004398.php#004398).
