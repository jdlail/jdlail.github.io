Sometimes the react is better than the first act. [Mathew Ingram](https://www.mathewingram.com/work/2007/06/22/newspapers-suffering-from-bad-math/) and [Steve Yelvington](https://www.yelvington.com/20070622/tracking_the_inksniffer) have good posts on British newspaper consultant John Duncan [Webster's Dictionary of Audience Exaggeration: How internet metrics promote the myth of the dying newspaper](https://blog.inksniffer.com/2007/06/20/abc-abce-circulation-newspapers-internet-readership.aspx). Yelvington has several nuggets, but this one I can't pass up quoting:

> However, the notion that a newspaper's daily print sales figures should be multiplied by some factor to derive actual readers is wishful-thinking crap, and especially so in markets where the newspaper is home delivered, such as is typical in the United States. Try dividing! Once again, I ran over this morning's paper with my car on my way to work.
