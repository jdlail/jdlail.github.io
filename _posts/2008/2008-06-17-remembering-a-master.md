[![M.L. Owens](/images/photo1_seagrove-thumb-150x105.webp)](/images/photo1_seagrove.webp)Reading this [blog post](https://jonbowens.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/my-grandpa/) by Sanford (N.C.) Herald reporter Jonathan Owens about his grandfather, M.L. Owens, reminded me of my own visits with "M.L." I have a few pieces of his pottery -- I wish I had more. I particularly like his [salt glaze pottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_glaze_pottery).  
  
He was, indeed, a true character. He could be a bit gruff and then regale his listener with some remarkably funny stories all in the space of a few minutes.  
  
Unpretentious, individualistic, a skilled artisan.  
  
I've read that he added the "s" to the family name, but I don't know the story behind that. But he is part of a whole family of related Owen/Owenses that [loom tall in any history](https://www.benowenpottery.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=30&Itemid=41) of North Carolina pottery as pioneers and who continue the tradition today.
