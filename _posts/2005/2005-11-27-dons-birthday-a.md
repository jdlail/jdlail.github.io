The Lail family had a birthday party/reunion Saturday at [Mt. Bethel United Methodist Church](https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&lr=&q=mt+bethel&near=Bethlehem,+NC+28601&sa=X&oi=locald&radius=0.0&cid=35757570,-81328858,3852231607511230870&li=lmd&z=3) in the Bethlehem community near Hickory, NC.  It was uncle Don Lail's birthday (11/25/1925) birthday and the whole Virginia clan (which I hadn't seen in many, many years ... most of my cousins' children I had never met). ![](/images/photos/drinking.webp) As is usual with these rare affairs, there was a lot of eating ... and some drinking ....  
And that lead to some finger pointing .... ![](/images/photos/pointing.webp)  
![](/images/photos/andthis.webp) And finally to things like this ....  
![](/images/photos/tee.webp) However, everyone went home happy with cool T-Shirts (courtesy of Donnie). ... I'll post some photos later.
