![Drive-in](/images/150drivein.webp)Mindy McAdams on how mainstream media is much like a movie theater of her youth.  
  
> It's like the movie theater in the small town where I grew up. A small, family-owned theater, it only played second-run movies. It was open only on Friday and Saturday. There was one screen, and one new movie each week. From the time I was 9 or 10 years old, I went to that theater every week, no matter what was playing. I had very little access to movies otherwise.
>
> Today I have Netflix, BitTorrent, and hundreds of cable TV channels.
>
> The family closed that movie theater back in the early days of the VCR.
