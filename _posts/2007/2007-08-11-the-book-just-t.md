In early 2006, according to [Greg Sterling](https://gesterling.wordpress.com/2007/08/11/what-people-missed-in-the-tmp-data/), the Kelsey Group found print Yellow Pages were the “first choice” for local business information. Fast forward a mere year and a half, and a new study from [TMP Directional Marketing](https://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070802005689&newsLang=en) finds _60 percent_ of consumers use the Internet as their primary information source for yellow page type information. Sterling says:

Is the venerable phone directory good for anything other than flattening papers? Some 90 percent believe a printed yellow pages is more accurate and complete than other sources, but two out of three are _USING_ other sources first. I think the tipping point is being reached in a lot Internet spaces and movement to Internet platforms and technologies is accelerating.
