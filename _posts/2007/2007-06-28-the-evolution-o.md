We've launched a new [knoxnews.com](https://www.knoxnews.com/) today. I thought some folks might like to see the last three designs of knoxnews (sorry, not sure if I have one from further back, unfortunately). The first was used for three or four years and was "retired" in April 2005. We thought it was very tired by then. The second one is the original successor look, but I noticed in looking at the home page yesterday, we had made more "adjustmenets" by the end of its run than I had thought. The one on the right is an early morning shot of the new, current design. You can click on each image to get a larger view. _Update: Jay Small explains many of the[nuances](https://smallinitiatives.com/2007/06/28/scripps-moves-knoxnews-to-ellington/)._ [![knoxnews -- april 2005](/images/oldfrontpageknox-thumb.webp)](/images/oldfrontpageknox.webp) [![knoxnews -- July 2005](/images/newsite071205knoxnews-thumb.webp)](/images/newsite071205knoxnews.webp)[![June 2007](/images/newknoxnews062807b-thumb.webp)](/images/newknoxnews062807b.webp)
