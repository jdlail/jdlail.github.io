[![Narcotic Use](/images/lvsunmap.webp)](https://www.lasvegassun.com/multimedia/rx_interactive/)Tennessee ranks No.1 in morphine and codeine use, No. 2 in hydrocodone, No. 3 in oxvcodone, No. 4 in meperidine, and No. 6 in fentanvl, according to this [info-packed, but easy to understand map](https://www.lasvegassun.com/multimedia/rx_interactive/) from the Rob Curley crew at the Las Vegas Sun.  
  
I'm sure these stellar rankings are included in the state's economic development and tourism pitches. Don't you?  
  
_* Rankings are based on state per capita use in 2006_.
