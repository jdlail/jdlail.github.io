A roundup of the December Carnival of Journalism [is up](https://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/dec/15/carnival-of-journalism-round-up) on the Guardian Developer Blog.  
  
My offering was called [Just Surprise Me](/2011/12/just-surprise-me.html) and is one of 19 that tackled this month's topic of:  
  
> _With it being December, we thought we w_ _ould adopt a Christmas theme for this month's topic - and pick something, in keeping with being hosted by a Developer blog, that we could ask of both technologists and journalists._  
>
> _If you are a journalist, what would be the best present from programmers and developers that Santa Claus could leave under your Christmas tree?_  
>
> _And, correspondingly, if you are a programmer or developer, what would be the best present from journalism that Father Christmas could deliver down your chimney?_

Check them out; some excellent reads.
