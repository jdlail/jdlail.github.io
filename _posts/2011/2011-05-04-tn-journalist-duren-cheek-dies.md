Tom Humphrey has the news about the death of retired UPI Tennessee bureau chief and Tennessean reporter [Duren Cheek](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/humphrey/2011/05/veteran-tn-newsman-duren-cheek.html).  

Cheek's bio on his Facebook page says:  

> Spent most of my life in the news business. Started with UPI before graduating from UT. Got so frustrated as a beginner that I marched down to the Marine Corps recruiting office and was ready to sign up. Fortunately, the Sergeant was out for coffee and I came to my senses and got out of there before he got back. I began my career at the Knoxville UPI bureau, located in the News-Sentinel City Room.
