The New York Times features a look at a  [weekend in Knoxville](https://travel.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/travel/08Hours.html). I must hang with the wrong crowd, or at least with the people writer Allison Glock knows. I have never heard Knoxville referred to as the "the couch."  
  
KnoxVegas, K-Town, Knoxpatch, yes. But "the couch," no, never.  
  
The accompanying slide show to the article includes a WDVX Blue Plate Special show. Online Producer [Talid Magdy](https://www.knoxnews.com/staff/talid-magdy/) has a weekly [series of videos](https://www.knoxnews.com/blueplatespecial/) on those shows.  
  
**Update:** [KnoxvilleTalks is doing a "couch" poll.](https://knoxvilletalks.com/2008/06/06/couching-knoxville-hidden-nickname/)  So unless you're a couch potato, head on over there.
