Uber-bloggers Helen and Glenn Reynolds have a [podcast](https://politicscentral.com/2007/01/19/the_glenn_and_helen_show_gordo.php) with Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz about print and online and why newspaper publishers should be adapting to the new era (duh); why young people don't read newspapers; and he offers a view of blogging as "a great journalistic art form." Good stuff.
