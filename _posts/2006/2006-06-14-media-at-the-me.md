Tags: [Bonnaroo](https://technorati.com/tag/Bonnaroo) | [Outdoor Festivals](https://technorati.com/tag/outdoor festivals) The KnoxNews online team is gearing up for complete and innovative -- and even off-the-wall -- coverage of this weekend's Bonnaroo festival led by audacious Lauren Spuhler, the online producer who will be reporting from the scene. Check it [out](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/spuhler/). We will have (and already have posted) some lively, fun and interesting content. The question I have is even with the mostly sunny [forecast](https://www.knoxnews.com/kns/weather/weather/0,1406,KNS_372_TYS,00.html), will the Manchester farm yet again become a sea of mud?
