A very beautiful March Saturday in Knoxville. Sunny, 60 or so, breezy.

Jogging (I call it jogging ... a fast walker could pass me, no doubt) at [Lakeshore](https://www.ci.knoxville.tn.us/greenways/lakeshore.asp),

I could hear: *The yells from the soccer fields.* The ping of aluminum bats at the batting cage. * Walkers on their cell phones. A wonderful hint of spring in early March. The [forecast](https://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/forecasts/TNZ069.php?warncounty=TNC093&city=Knoxville) looks equally splendid.
