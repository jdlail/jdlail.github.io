[![Radiohead In Rainbow](/images/100107radiohead-thumb-150x119.webp)](/images/100107radiohead.webp)

Unbelievable. Radiohead's Oct. 10 release of "[In Rainbows](https://www.inrainbows.com/Store/Quickindex.html)" is available for whatever you're willing to pay for it! In the shopping cart, click on the question mark beside price and it says: "It's up to you."  
  
This is big!  
  
Shane Richmond [says](https://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/sept07/radiohead.htm) "_Radiohead may have done irreparable damage to the industry's traditional business model._ "  
  
And who needs iTunes!
