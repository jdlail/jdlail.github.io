Some election eve frivolous fun. If she's reading the New York Times, she's probably a Democrat. If he's reading the Wall Street Journal, he's probably a Republican. That's the upshot of a [Neilsen//Netratings](https://www.nielsen-netratings.com/pr/pr_061101.pdf) report on site traffic by party affiliation via the [Center for Media Research](https://www.centerformediaresearch.com/cfmr_brief.cfm?fnl=061106). Top five favs for Republicans:

* RushLimbaugh.com
* NewsMax.com
* Bill O'Reilly.com
* Drudge Report
* Salt Lake Tribune
Top five favs for Democrats:
* BlackAmericaWeb.com
* AOL BlackVoices
* BET.com
* Salon.com
* Village Voice
The favs are based on the percentage of users of one party. For example, nearly 85 percent of Limbaugh's Web site users describe themselves as Republican. Tags: [political parties](https://technorati.com/tag/political+parties) | [party affiliation](https://technorati.com/tag/party+affiliation)
