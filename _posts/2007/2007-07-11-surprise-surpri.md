[![Gomer Pyle](/images/gomerpyle-thumb.webp)](/images/gomerpyle.webp)Damn, [I'm a 10](https://www.careerdistinction.com/onlineid/). The "Online Identity Calculator (beta)" says:

> Congratulations. You are digitally distinct. This is the nirvana of online identity. Keep up the good work, and remember that your Google results can change as fast as the weather in New England. So, regularly monitor your online identity. Read Chapter 11 of Career Distinction for more ideas on how to continue to build your brand online.

LOL, I hadn't seen this buzz phrase used on the site: "GQ (Google Quotient)?" I also couldn't believe that a search for "Jack Lail" resulted in 29,700 results. _Well Gaw-aw-aw-leee -- Gomer Pyle._ The site hypes a book I haven't read -- [Career Distinction: Stand Out By Building Your Brand by William Arruda and Kirsten Dixson](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=Career%20Distinction&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&index=books&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=ur2&o=1) \-- and uses the calculator to populate an email list. Novel as well as viral, I suppose.
