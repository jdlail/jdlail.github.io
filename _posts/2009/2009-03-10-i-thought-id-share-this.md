The informal agreement among several Tennessee newspapers to share content as well as some ideas on how to carry it beyond that is getting a good bit of attention. Editor & Publisher also is coming out with a "major feature" on content sharing this week which will be interesting to see.  
  
[Kent Flanagan](https://twitter.com/kentflanagan), [Jay Rosen](https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu) and [Jeff Jarvis](https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis) are thinking about ways newspapers can take content sharing beyond newspapers. Interesting stuff; interesting times.  
  
Here;s what is being said. (Know of one I missed, send me a link to jack @ jacklail.com.)
