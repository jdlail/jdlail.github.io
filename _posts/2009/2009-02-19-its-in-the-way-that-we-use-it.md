Scripps exec [Jay Small](https://smallinitiatives.com/) on newspaper video:  
  
> Focus on video when it is the best storytelling tool for the job. For example: Raw video from a warehouse fire? Great - rough cut it and post it. Two minutes of a print reporter standing in front of a courthouse reading components of a prose story? Not so good. Trying to mimic broadcast news, with anchors, sets, graphics packages and the like, is probably a waste of effort.
