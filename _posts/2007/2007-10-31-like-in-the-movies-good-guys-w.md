An update on the Oct. 4, 2007, [posting](/2007/10/aint-that.html) about YouTube pulling a video of knoxnews that was flagged by 20th Century Fox for copyright infringement.  
  
The video above of the Reno 911! guys was shot by our TV critic Terry Morrow and so we filed a counter-claim with YouTube. I got an overnight email that the video has been restored.  
  
The YouTube process is pretty streamlined, but still, we should have never gotten the copyright infringement claim in the first place.
