I'm thinking this is the type of site that would rate positively with the subjects in the AP's new study on [youth-adult readers](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=ap+study+young-adult+&btnG=Search+Blogs). It fun and short! Test your who-must-have-said-that skills at [pullquotes.org](https://pullquotes.org/). Looks to be from the [Sunlight foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/).  
  
The full AP study, [A New Model for News,  Studying the Deep Structure of Young-Adult News Consumption](https://www.ap.org/newmodel.pdf).  
  
Has a newspaper done something similar? It didn't leave me with "news fatigue" feeling.
