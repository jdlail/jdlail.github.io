Interesting take on the [Google-newspaper](https://www.deepjiveinterests.com/2006/11/06/google-to-use-faerie-magicks-in-tracking-new-print-ads/) ad deal.

> In this day and age of declining newspaper fortunes one of the biggest agents of change AWAY from newspapers, that directly has a competitor to newspapers (news.google.com), and that steals away advertising away from newspapers (adwords), is now going BACK to newspapers to sell their ad space (and getting a cut of the deal as part of it)?
