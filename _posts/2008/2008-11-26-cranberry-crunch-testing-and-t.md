[![11262008001](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/3060785909_7d2ff9f745_m.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/3060785909/ "11262008001 by jacklail, on Flickr")Early this morning I made some Cranberry Crunch to bring to the office (recipe below). I'm not sure where I got that recipe, but it meets my easy test.  
  
I used the results to test how well the new [Nokia N96](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DN5030?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001DN5030)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001DN5030) we have takes photos. The flash was turned off and the camera was set at its largest image. I will admit to having to have had to read the directions to actually get it take a photo rather than just focusing on an image, but the manual resolved all.  
  
**Cranberry Crunch**  
  
1 cup sugar  
1 tbsp cornstarch  
1/2 cup water  
1 tsp vanilla  
2 cups cranberries  
1/2 cup raisins  
  
1 cup oats  
1 cup brown sugar  
1/2 cup all purpose flour  
1/3 cup butter  
  
Combine sugar, cornstarch, water, vanilla, cranberries, and raisins. Boil over medium heat. Remove heat and simmer 5 minutes and cool  
slightly.  
  
Mix oats, brown sugar, flour and butter. Sprinkle 1/2 cup crumbs in bottom of greased 8" square pan. Spread cranberry filling. Top  
with remaining crumbs. Bake at 350 F for 45 minutes.
