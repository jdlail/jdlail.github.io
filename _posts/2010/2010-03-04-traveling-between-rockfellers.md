![Nancy Sweezy](/images/nancysweezy.webp)The [remarkable story](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/arts/design/24sweezy.html) of Nancy Sweezy, the woman who may have just saved pottery making in Seagrove, N.C.  
  
I had talked to her a couple of times, but knew little of her amazing life.  
  
The National Endowment of the Arts named her a "national treasure" in 2006.
