The NAA's 2007 Digital Edge (Edgie) Awards finalists were announced late last week and the full list was [posted](https://www.naa.org/sitecore/content/Home/DigitalEdge/EdgieAwards.aspx) this week. The winners will be announced in late January at the Connections Conference in Las Vegas. Knoxnews is a finalist in three categories in the daily print circulation group of 75,000 – 250,000:

* Best Overall News Site; [knoxnews.com](https://www.knoxnews.com/)
* Best Classified Innovation: [KnoxJobs.tv](https://knoxjobs.tv)
* Best Use of Interactive Media: [RandomThis](https://www.knoxnews.com/randomthis/)

There's a lot of excellent entries in the contest. The judging in this contest is tough in that the top sites are usually very close in meeting the judging criteria. It's nice to be recognized as a finalist and best of luck to all finalists!
