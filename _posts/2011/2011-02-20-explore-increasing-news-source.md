I participated in the February Carnival of Journalism. Lots of good ideas/observations in these posts. [David Cohn](https://www.digidave.org/ "David Cohn"), who organized the [Carnival](https://carnivalofjournalism.com/2011/02/18/carnival-roundup-no-2-increasing-news-sources-jcarn/) writes:  
  
> We have almost 40+ responses to the broad question: "What can I do to increase the number of news sources?" Many of your sentiments overlapped, but each person brought a unique perspective to the mix. Several agreed that increasing news sources is a bad idea, and others championed it. That's what this carnival is for -- to dialogue and engage one another and the community at large.
