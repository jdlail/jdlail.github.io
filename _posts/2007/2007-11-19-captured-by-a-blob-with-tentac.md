All these years, I've been working for a [media blob](https://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/is-the-media-blob-passe/) that plans to morph into fraternal twins.  
  
Wait, it is a big ole [media octopus, now cutting off tentacles](https://www.slate.com/id/2178069/nav/fix/).

What would you pay for the Los Angeles Times, the Nashville Tennessean, the Des Moines Register, Newsday, the Dallas Morning News, the Knoxville News Sentinel, or any other chain-owned property? Don't send your bids to me a slate.pressbox@gmail.com. Send them to the newspapers' respective owners and send me the finder's fee.
