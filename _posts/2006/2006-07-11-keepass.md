[LifeHacker](https://lifehacker.com/software/passwords/geek-to-live-securely-track-your-passwords-184774.php) did a very positive post on [KeePass](https://keepass.sourceforge.net/). I've been using this password database program for awhile and I really like it as well -- and it's free. Try it! I notice there is a slghtly new version available.Think I'll go off and update. Later.
