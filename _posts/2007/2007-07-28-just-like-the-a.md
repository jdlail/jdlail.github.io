Arvinder Kang from Ole Miss pointed me to this strange project from a guy who grew up in Knoxville and South Africa, and now lives in Greensboro, NC. He's creating an IMAX movie from still photos. Ah, yes. There's a [web site](https://www.outsideinthemovie.com/) Stephen van Vuuren says he is creating an "IMAX movie in the basement." I think it's kind of a Billy Bob Thornton "[The Astronaut Farmer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469263/)" does a big budget movie in the basement instead of a rocket ship in the barn. According to the Web site, the movie _"Outside In" is a giant-screen visual symphony that aims to artistically bridge science and spirituality as it journeys from the big bang to the Cassini-Huygens Mission at Saturn."Outside In" is a giant-screen visual symphony that aims to artistically bridge science and spirituality as it journeys from the big bang to the Cassini-Huygens Mission at Saturn._ Well, he tells his story here:

His [blog](https://outsideinthemovie.com/blog/) explains the "YouTube" effect of the video clip this week. Charlie Farmer made it into space; maybe Stephen van Vuuren will make this movie.
