[![The Comcast Slowsky turtles](/images/the_slowskys.webp)](https://www.ihatemisic.com/story_09_slowskys.html)Great day in Knoxville Sunday. Sunny, windy and warm (in the mid-60s). Went jogging at my favorite [greenway](https://www.ci.knoxville.tn.us/greenways/lakeshore.asp) and did 7.75 miles in 1:20:48 (156 average heart rate bpm). Yep, that's [Slowsky](https://www.ihatemisic.com/story_09_slowskys.html); I usually don't jog/walk that long -- or far. It was good. Lots of folks and dogs out. Only two problems: it was phewy on the sewer plant side cause of the rain, I guess, and the strong wind broke a big limb that hit me in the shoulder while was I was on the river side of the course (sort of surprised me). For the week, I've gone 15.75 miles jogging or on the elliptical. Including non-cardio, I exercised 3:04 hours and burned 2670 calories. At my pace, maybe I ought to sign up with Jason Calacanis' highly public [Fatblogging](https://technorati.com/search/Fatblogging) campaign. He's got a domain name, [fatblogging.com](https://www.fatblogging.com/), mapped to his blog, where he's been spending a good bit of time tracking his exercise and diet regimes, and trading tips on programs, diets and equipment. I was listening to some good stuff to keep me moving: [Michael Power's](https://www.michaelpowersfrequency.com/michaelpowers.com.html) [Prodigal Son](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=prodigal%20son&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&index=music&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=ur2&o=1). Fav track: [Lay Down the Hooch](https://www.michaelpowersfrequency.com/downloads/Lay%20The%20Hooch%20clip.mp3) (sample clip).
