Do you have a "SLAM ToolKit?"

I presented what I call the SLAM ToolKit for journalists this afternoon to the Tennessee Press Association meeting in Knoxville.

SLAM stands for:

* Simple
* Lean
* Affordable
* Mobile

Yeah, it's corny, but, hopefully, memorable.

You can [see the deck here](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/AwBWCAESEP0GkQN3JglklEkk-R7mW8caKlA2cqhzR4DLT4n01otC50632z25nh7EcJ3xFshaG1KdyoUn5xxUtv9MfAMCUCAQEEIGWNXmm0gpQB4vMsPvtqwfZIbPsFnhoGkl-w6CQ4mWeW#SLAM_Toolkit). In many categories, there may be better picks (and if there are, I'd like to know about them), but the first choices reflect apps I have used, at least a bit.
