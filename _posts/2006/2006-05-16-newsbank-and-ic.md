Got a copy of a news release this morning that Newsbank and iCopyright have cut a deal whereby Newsbank will be added iCopyright's copyright licensing technology into its database. That's good news. We already use both! Our data was tagged for iCopyright on Knoxnews, but articles that were in the Newsbank database were not. It's a natural partnership. Congrats to all.
