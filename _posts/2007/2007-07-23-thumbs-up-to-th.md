Woohoo! Jackie Broyles and Dunlap did wonders for Tennessee stereotypes during the CNN/YouTube debate on Monday night. They were funny, but my, oh my, they're the image Tennessee wants to project about itself? They've got a lot of other videos [here](https://www.travisandjonathan.com/RedStateUpdate).

The debate questions in general were excellent and showed the diversity of the American people. It worked better than I expected. The primary drawback of the format is the inability to have follow up questions. The health care questions in the words and pictures of real people dealing with life, death and illness framed the issues better than any panel of journalists I've watched. It was compelling.
