If there was a Billboard Top 10 for journalism hot topics, the discussion on online comments on news sites would have gone platinum several times over.  
  
There's a new round of debate, discussion and general consternation this spring.  
  
The [Yakima Herald-Republic](https://yakimaherald.com/ "Yakima Herald-Republic") shut down its commenting system just over 10 days ago and will come back in July with a system that requires real names.  
  
Deirdre Edgar,[](https://www.latimes.com/ "Los Angeles Times") readers' representative of the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/ "Los Angeles Times"), had piece on June 10 headlined "Our goal of civility is falling short."  
  
Edgar explains of the measures The L.A. Times and other newspapers are taking to better manage comments while continuing to allow them. But she included a line from an email from Op-Ed columnist [Patt Morrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patt_Morrison "Patt Morrison"). who said:"Personally, I think most comments were of a higher quality when they required pen, paper and a stamp."  
  
The [Boston Globe](https://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ "The Boston Globe") is joining a growing number of news sites that are outsourcing some pieces of comment management.  
  
The Associated Press Managing Editors circulated a survey last week to newsroom leaders seeking feedback on online comments.  
  
Here's a roundup of recent articles and discussion on comments.
