Have you seen one of these? I first read about the Sonice Impact T-amp (Sonic Impact 5066) in the Oct. 3, 2005, Forbes magazine ([article](https://www.keepmedia.com/Auth.do?extId=10022&uri=/archive/forbes/2005/1003/067.html) in pay archives now). The article raved about the sound quality of the $39 amp, which was introduced in 2003. Other rave about it, too:

> Warning: this has been the most thrilling and incredible experience I've had with a component in, say, 25 years of HiFi listening. This website has existed since 1995, I've reviewed hundreds of HiFi components, inexpensive and ridiculously overpriced ones. I never - repeat - NEVER came across such a stunning piece of gear in all of these years.

> ... the Sonic Impact T-amp is an absolutely brilliant piece of equipment that revolutionizes sound quality performance at a true budget price. Prior to the T-amp, a great-sounding $39 amplifier was unheard of. That makes the Sonic Impact unparalleled. Heck, even for $390, it would be unparalleled - it's simply a really great little amplifier.

\-- [sixmoons.com](https://www.6moons.com/audioreviews/sonicimpact/t.html) I decided to get one last year. I'm not an audophile, but this thing is amazing. I went to Best Buy and bought set of bookshelf speakers. They sound great hooked up to this little battery-powered amp with one on/off volume knob and that's it. Hook it up to yoru IPod. Hook it up to your TV. Hook it up to most anything. Runs on eight AA batteries. My son has "adopted" it and is putting the "sold separately" AC adapter on his Christmas list. It's small. It's simple. It works great. Meets all my requirements. Search for prices for it. You can buy it from the [manufacturer](https://www.si5.com/products.php?cID=42) for $39, but it was selling for less at [Parts-Express.com](https://www.parts-express.com/webpage.cfm?&WebPage_ID=3&manufacturer=348&raid=1&rak=sonic_impact). I'm not sure why the Amazon vendor (Amazon doesn't sell it itself) is on the high side, but read the user comments on the item description page.
