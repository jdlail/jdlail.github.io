Now, I've hooked you.  
  
The disruption of  traditional media even includes porn. The commercial porn industry is being hurt by a combination of "piracy" and amateur video uploads, says George Simpson in a [MediaPost column](https://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&s=67421&Nid=34326&p=222600). DVD sales and rentals are down 15 to 25 percent. Sound familiar?  
  
The industry apparently will fight back by touting quality ("We use good-quality lighting and very good sound.")  
  
(via [Terry Heaton](https://www.thepomoblog.com/archive/when-its-unsimulated-its-um-porn/), who I think is right in thinking this probably has implications for mainstream video producers as well)
