Instead of newspapers and other media companies buying parts of sports teams and naming rights to stadiums and arenas, maybe the sports teams need to buy part of newspapers ... the Dallas Mavericks Newsroom, the Tennessee Titans Press Room, the Atlanta Falcons Satellite Printing Plant?  
  
There would be fewer headaches for team owners than Mark Cuban's "beatwriter cooperative" idea.

> Buying anything more than small ads in papers  to promote price promotions for the Mavs has not worked for us. I would far rather subsidize in depth coverage of the Mavs, even without any editorial control then spend more money on advertising. Im a firm believer that there is a foundation of readers who use the sports pages as their primary source of local team information. That number may not be as big as it used to be, nor will it be as big in the future. Thats ok.  The numbers may not make the newspaper shareholders happy, but they are of sufficient numbers to have an impact on the local sports market.

Hey, before you say, there goes that crazy Mark Cuban again, [read his post](https://blogmaverick.com/2008/12/24/why-pro-sports-need-newspapers/) on a beat cooperative with writers funded by teams but working for newspapers. Given the current conditions, it's not that far-fetched. _Yeah, and next they'll only be delivering dailies three days a week._  
  
*But I still write whatever I want.
