Seriously, there's aton being written ([here](https://gigaom.com/2010/03/01/news-has-become-a-social-experience-pew/) and [here](https://prfinishline.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-pew-study-has-significant.html) and [here](https://www.niemanlab.org/2010/03/loving-mobile-and-print-five-key-findings-from-pews-new-news-study/)) about the new study from the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism on [Understanding the Participatory News Consumer](https://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/understanding_participatory_news_consumer), but that one sentence is a tell about printed newspapers.
