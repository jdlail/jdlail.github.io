It is not about just refashioning journalism, it's about reinventing the business proposition for news. [Janet Coats](https://www.facebook.com/janetcoats "Janet Coats") of the Patterson Foundation [wrote yesterday](https://nmj.thepattersonfoundation.org/?awesm=fbshare.me_AOWhp&p=63):

> For journalism to work, it has to prove its value to the community it serves, and proving that value means attracting business revenue - whether through advertising, subscription, or underwriting by an audience committed to the coverage your provide. Likely, it will be a combination of all those things, and more.
