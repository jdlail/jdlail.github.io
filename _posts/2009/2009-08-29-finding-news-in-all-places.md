[Jeff Cutler](https://www.jeffcutler.com/) posted this video to Qik.com of fellow panelist [Bill Adee](https://www.google.com/profiles/billadee), editor of digital media at the Chicago Tribune, during our session on link journalism Thursday afternoon with Publish2 CEO [Scott Karp](https://www.publish2.com/journalists/scott-karp) at the [SPJ convention](https://www.spj.org/wp.asp) in Indianapolis.  
  
Adee talked about [ChicagoNow](https://www.chicagonow.com/), [Chicago Breaking News](https://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/blog/) and [Colonel Tribune](https://twitter.com/coloneltribune). We had a great group with great questions, but, hey, you should have been there!
