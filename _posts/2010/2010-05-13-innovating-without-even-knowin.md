![Ray Meese](/images/RayMeese.webp)Damon Kiesow did a story today on [Poynter.org](https://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=134&aid=182870) with Ventura County Star Visuals Editor [Ray Messe](https://www.vcstar.com/staff/ray-meese/) about the newspaper's use of the iPhone to shoot video. Meese did a presentation about those efforts at the Online News Association [workshop in Nashville](/2010/02/answer-the-call-for-training.html) on April 9.  
  
> It wasn't until he spoke at an Online News Association seminar in Nashville recently that he realized the paper was breaking new ground in mobile news gathering. "Once I started talking and realized what other people were doing," he said he discovered Ventura's approach "was more cutting edge than I gave it credit for."

Meese's presentation in Nashville was chock full of apps and accessories he had tried for doing journalism with the iPhone. It was fascinating. Several of the programs and accessories are mentioned with links in Kiesow's piece.  
  
Sets the bar pretty high for next year's workshop.
