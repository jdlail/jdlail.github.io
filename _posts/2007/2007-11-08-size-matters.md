![David Linthicum photo](/images/1108sizematters.webp)The problem with newspapers' online [business model](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2007/11/new_vs_old_medi.shtml) might be size matters.  
  
(Interesting FYI: [Instapundit.com](https://www.instapundit.com/) was No. 3 in knoxnews's referring domains list for Wednesday mainly on links to a [gun blog posting](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2007/11/cnn_gets_gun_co.shtml) and secondarily on links to the above item. The only two domains that topped it were Google, of course, and Legacy.com, the obituary site.)
