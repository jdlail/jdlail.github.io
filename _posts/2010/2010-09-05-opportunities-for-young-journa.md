[E.W. Scripps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._W._Scripps "E. W. Scripps") is recruiting journalists for internships that start as early as October chainwide.  
  
The internships last 24 weeks and there's even relocation money of $500.  
  
CubReporters.org has [some details](https://blog.cubreporters.org/2010/09/entry-level-multimedia-journalist.html). [The News Sentinel](https://www.knoxnews.coml/ "The Knoxville News-Sentinel"), where I work, is looking for two page designers, but apply through the [official site](https://www.scripps.apply2jobs.com/ProfExt/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&RID=2614) and not directly to the newspaper.  
  
And did I say these are paid internships? They certianly are.
