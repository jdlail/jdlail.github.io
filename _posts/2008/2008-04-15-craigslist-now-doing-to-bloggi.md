Did you know Craigslist [had a blog](https://blog.craigslist.org/)?  
  
[![spaceship](/images/578467547.3-thumb-150x112.webp)](/images/578467547.3.webp)You can find out more about this [spaceship for sale](https://blog.craigslist.org/2008/04/space-ship-for-sale/) and how that weird Oregon case shows Craigslist is not a hideout for criminals. _"Criminals take a giant risk when they use craigslist in conjunction with illegal activity, since an electronic trail is created that law enforcement officers can easily follow_ ," the blog says.  
  
There's more. Craigslist founder Craig Newmark also set up a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/craignewmark) on April 12 so people can find how boring his life is. He's on a trip to Israel right now.  Recent Tweet: _My first rocket attack, and I eat algae._ Well, he says his life is boring. Anyway, hope he keeps it up. Newmark also has [his own blog](https://www.cnewmark.com/) that has been around longer than the new Craigslist blog.
