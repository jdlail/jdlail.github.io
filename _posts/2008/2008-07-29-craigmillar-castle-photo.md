![Thumbnail image for Schmap guide](/assets_c/2008/07/schmap.cropped-thumb-290x260.webp)One of my photos (on left in image at right) of [Craigmiller Castle](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/528782551/) got included in the "newly released fifth  
edition of our Schmap Edinburgh Guide." The screen shot at right shows how it looks in an iPhone/iTouch and here is how it looks in its [regular web version](https://www.schmap.com/edinburgh/sights_historic/#r=none&mapview=Map&tab=Places&topleft=55.93223,-3.13804&bottomright=55.92928,-3.13502&i=165431.jpg).  
  
I suspect the creative commons license I use was appealing, but  Schmap  did ask to use it and I'm happy if someone likes it. It was taken during our vacation last summer.
