[![Oldest longleaf pine](/images/gnrpinetree-thumb-150x112.webp)](https://www.news-record.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071202/NRSTAFF/312020014/-1/NEWSRECRSSARKIVE)You think of redwoods living a long time, giant awe-inspiring towering trees, but a pine tree?  
  
I noticed in the Charlotte Observer today a story picked up from the Greensoboro News & Record about a stunted, gnarly pine tree that scientists say is 459 years old. Yes, 459 years.  
  
The discovery is thought to be the [oldest longleaf pine in the world](https://www.news-record.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071202/NRSTAFF/312020014/-1/NEWSRECRSSARKIVE), but it’s possible there are others even older where it was found in the[Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve](https://www.ils.unc.edu/parkproject/visit/wewo/home.html) in Southern Pines, N.C.  
  
The tree, which by all accounts is not a majestic looking specimen, was discovered by two researchers from the University of North Carolina at Greeneboro Tree Ring Science Lab as part of drought research.  
  
Henri Grissino-Mayer, a longleaf pine expert at the University of Tennessee, says of the discovery:  
  
> "We have found older longleaf pines but they are all dead now," Grissino-Mayer said. He noted that the oldest on record lived 490 years in Florida.  
>
> "Finding a longleaf pine dating back that far is exceedingly rare, extremely exceptional."
