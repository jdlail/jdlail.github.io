It's tough in newspaper newsroom, but it may be tougher in broadcast newsrooms. A Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism [survey](https://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/news_leaders_and_future) done in association with the American Society of News Editors and the Radio Television Digital News Association finds:  
  
> Broadcast news executives are noticeably more pessimistic about journalism's future than editors at newspaper-based operations. Broadcasters think their profession is headed in the wrong direction by a margin of nearly two-to-one (64% versus 35%). By contrast, editors working at newspapers were split (49% wrong direction versus 51% right direction). A year ago, journalists who were members of the Online News Association surveyed by PEJ fell in between these two, 54% wrong direction, 45% right.
