![2008-Obama-gold-animation.gif](/images/2008-Obama-gold-animation.gif)One of my friends, Robin Raskin, and Steven Edelson are winding up again [electionwatches.com](https://www.electionwatches.com/), a Web e-commerce site for presidential election years with a line of "waving" candidate watches.  
  
Yeah, that's right, "waving" watches.  
  
"If the Interent were a country, Obama would win.Visit [www.electionwatches.com](https://www.electionwatches.com/) and check out my every four year pastime," Raskin writes.  
  
Of course, there's still "time" for McCain. They do a "[poll](https://www.electionwatches.com/polls.html)" based on watch sales. Vote buying at its best and completely legal.  
  
From the PR release:  
  
> Waving Good-bye or Hello? The watches have a clever "third hand" that allows your fav candidate to wave back and forth, like a presidential metronome. In contrast to cheesy buttons and bumper stickers, these watches make a discreet, sophisticated political statement. Plus, by choosing a political timepiece to adorn your wrist, there's the added utility of always being on time: A conversation piece and a timepiece for the price of one.

I would add it's likely these watches are the only time you will see the candidates on time.
