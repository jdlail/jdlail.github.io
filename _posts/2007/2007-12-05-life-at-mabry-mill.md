![Mabry Mill grounds](/images/travelingdanmabrymill.webp)Dan "[Dan Traveling](https://www.dantraveling.com/)" McCoig emailed to say he has a [new video up](https://dantraveling.blip.tv/file/506551). This one is on [Mabry Mill](https://www.nps.gov/blri/historyculture/index.htm) along the Blue Ridge Parkway. He's got a good series of videos going. The video explains the origin of the saying "wait your turn."
