I wanted to note this is in passing and April Fool's Day feels right: This blog turned five just a few weeks ago, on Feb. 18. For those who read it regularly, thank you! For those that read it all all, thank you, too.  
  
As they say in archeology stories, the site shows [signs of a primitive civilization](/2005/02/jack-lail-blog.html).  
  
During Random Mumblings' history, it has had some 1,602 posts (an average of .87 a day), 1,217 comments, 214 trackback links and over 86,000 spam comments or trackbacks blocked by TypePad AntiSpam.  
  
[Subscribing to this blog](https://feeds.jacklail.com/RandomMumblings) would be a splendid way of marking this milestone.
