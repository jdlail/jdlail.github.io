An interesting Twitter idea from [Kurt Greenbaum](https://twitter.com/kgreenbaum) and the [St. Louis Post-Dispatch](https://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/commutingtraffic/story/CD4C368B1E285D10862573B40066C39D?OpenDocument).  
  
And (just for [Paul Bradshaw](https://twitter.com/paulbradshaw)) that's not Twitter shovelware.
