John Edwards may not win the Democratic nomination for president in the 2008 campaign, but his use of online video is being [viewed](https://www.freedomtodiffer.com/freedom_to_differ/2007/01/online_video_is.html) as a tipping point in defining online video as a serious medium ready to content with traditional media. Edwards pre-announced his candidacy on YouTube before the official [launch](https://www.johnedwards.com/). That act has almost gotten him more buzz than the actual announcement (which was expected). I think it has gotten him more blogger buzz, but that's just a guess. The "[webisode](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=webisode)" is posted [here](https://www.freedomtodiffer.com/freedom_to_differ/2007/01/online_video_is.html). Al Gore invented the Internet; John Edwards invents video as a serious online medium. If Howard Dean's was the first Internet presidential political campaign, will Edwards' be the first to win YouTube?
