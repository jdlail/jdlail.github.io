Now that the histrionics of presidential election cycle are hopefully winding down, some good advice from Knoxville blogger Glenn Reynolds in a [Forbes column](https://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/11/04/hate-presidential-election-oped-cx_ghr_1104opedreynolds.html):  
  
> _We don't have to agree on issues, or on leaders. But if we can't agree that a free and fair election can produce a legitimate president even when it's not the candidate we like, then we've got a very serious problem.  _
