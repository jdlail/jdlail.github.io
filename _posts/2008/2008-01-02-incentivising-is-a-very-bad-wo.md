Some more thoughts on how to compensate online content creators.  
  
[Yoni Greenbaum](https://www.yonigreenbaum.com/index.php/20080102/an-approach-to-compensation-that-can-work/) says extend a performance bonus plan beyond writers to online producers and editors, too! _(Bring it on!)_  
  
[Scott Karp](https://publishing2.com/2008/01/01/can-pay-for-performance-improve-the-quality-of-content-on-the-web/) says pay for performance plans might spur traffic, but they may or may not improve quality becuase the Internet "turns a blind eye to quality." _(Quality? Just kidding.)_  
  
[Mathew Ingram](https://www.mathewingram.com/work/2008/01/01/pay-for-traffic-incentive-or-distortion/) says on balance incentivizing writers "in the long run it is likely to make them more intimately involved in their blogs, and more interested in developing a relationship with their readers, and that's a good thing."_( Like in taking more ownership of their worK?)_  
  
[Dan Blank](https://danblank.com/blog/2008/01/01/the-war-against-mediocre-online-editorial-content/) says to find sustainable online success, we must stop calling people bloggers - and work to create more journalists... who just happen to write for blogs. _(How true.)_  
  
I have some other blog postings [here](/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=tag%3Dcompensation&IncludeBlogs=25&limit=20) on the pay issue, including one that has a link to the full Nick Denton new-pay-plan memo (a must read for this subject). And there is more react at this [search results link](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=gawker+pay&btnG=Search+Blogs).  
  
While people can certainly pick at Nick Denton's plan, mainstream media hoping to make their way fully into digital  need to look at whether their compensation systems reflect their old business or their new.
