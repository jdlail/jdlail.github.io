Love this quote gem from Avinash Kaushik:  
  
> Back in the 1980's Jan Carlzon was trying to breathe new life into an ailing Scandinavian Air Services. He was famous for saying "You cannot improve one thing by 1000% but you can improve 1000 little things by 1%".

The post on [aggregating marginal gains](https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2009/03/aggregation-marginal-gains-recession-busting-analytics.html) is excellent, too.
