[![NCAA logo](/assets_c/2013/02/ncaa-thumb-250x251-2471.webp)](/images/ncaa.webp)A trio or more of [media](https://www.apme.com) [groups](https://asne.org/) [have been asking](https://apsportseditors.org/) the NCAA to sit down and talk about changes it has ordered in the coverage of NCAA events that are detrimental to news organizations and their audiences.  
  
So far, the NCAA just hasn't found the time for a sitdown; no doubt, busy counting the cash from some TV contract.

In an attempt to get some dialogue going, [this letter](https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apme.com/resource/resmgr/foi/NCAA_letter_00488347.pdf) was written by the American Society of News Editors' attorney, Kevin Goldberg, to outline the frustration with the NCAA's continued indifference to the requests and to put a spotlight on the changes the NCAA is putting in for the upcoming basketball tournaments.  
  
Talk about March Madness.
