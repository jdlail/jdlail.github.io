We're trying some new things on knoxnews for the Tennessee primary on Feb. 5.  
  
You can sign up for [text messages](https://www.myknoxnews.com/) for election results or follow the results on our [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/knoxnews) (log into Twitter and click "follow" on our page). We'll also be doing continous updates all day on election day on [knoxnews](https://www.knoxnews.com/).  
  
If you're an East Tennessee blogger who's blogging the election or photgraphing it or something else interesting, [let us know](mailto:lail@knews.com?subject=I%27m%20covering%20the%20election); we'll link to it.  
  
We're also asking people to send us photos from a polling place with a digital camera or your cell phone. We'll post them online. Just email your photo(s) to [shareonline@knews.com](mailto:shareonline@knews.com).  
  
I think this is going to be fun!
