Updated my Gallery photo album organizer from 1.5.0 to 2.0.2 on Friday. There were a few hiccups (the 2.x version is a major rewrite), but I worked through it. I like this piece of software -- and it's free. Find out more [here](https://gallery.menalto.com/). Better yet, browse some of my [albums](https://www.lailnet.com/gallery/). Who needs Flickr!
