Oh, wow, Ilana Arazie, is getting hyped on [Jewlicious.com](https://www.jewlicious.com/?p=3629) and snuck in an [AP The Hot List](https://video.ap.org/v/Legacy.aspx?g=6c9a7678-ac93-415d-9839-15b420673edc&f=TNKNN) and is doing stuff for [Amaldo.com](https://amaldo.com/blog/2007/06/30/ilana-donna-new-yorkers-take-on-a-mighty-heart/). Check out her vblog, [Downtonw Diary](https://ilanadonna.typepad.com/downtown_diary), for her latest. The video below is a recent one on online dating that I liked.

She's got a day job with the AP Online Video Network, but I wouldn't be surprised to see her build a pretty good audience around her video blogging. She's got the guerilla marketing going already. Hey, Ilana, go for it! Tags: [Ilana Arazie](https://technorati.com/tag/ilana arazie) | [video blogging](https://technorati.com/tag/video blogging) | [vblog](https://technorati.com/tag/vblog)
