It is for one of the folks on a panel I'm moderating this morning during the APME Conference in Nashville at the John Seigenthaler Cemter.  
  
Back in March in an [Advertising Age piece](https://adage.com/article/steve-rubel/social-media-lessons-gleaned-media-innovators/233207/), Steve Rubel highlighted some thoughts from Chad Parziman, director of community and social media for [Scripps Networks Interactive](https://www.scrippsnetworksinteractive.com/) in Knoxville.  
  
Scripps Networks Interactive owns HGTV, the Food Network and a suite of other video and web properties.  
  
Parizman told Rubel that the company had passed on putting a lot of resources into Google+, but did put resources into Pinterest after already seeing traffic from it.  
  
Traffic from [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) is exceeding 1 million page views a month for Scripps Networks, the article said.
