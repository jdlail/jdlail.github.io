The News Sentinel's photographers have a wonderful exhibit of their work in the back lobby of our building at 2332 News Sentinel Drive. It'll only be up through the end of February so come on by Monday-Friday during business hours. The photographer portfolios of stunning photographs are displayed on eight iMacs, one for each photographer. Each photographer selected at least 40 photos -- some more than double that number -- that rotate in a slide show on the iMacs. They do good work!
