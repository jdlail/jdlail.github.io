OK, I'm stealing this one honest from [Tommy's Table](https://ttomlinson.blogspot.com/2008/02/sum-up-charlotte-in-six-words.html). I'm a sucker for stuff like this anyway.

He's challenged people to describe Charlotte in six words. Why six words?

> The story goes that Ernest Hemingway once claimed his finest work consisted of six words: "For sale: baby shoes, never worn."
>
> The people at Smith magazine took that idea and ran with it, asking readers to send in six-word memoirs. They're now collected in a book, "Not Quite What I Was Planning: Six-Word Memoirs From Writers Famous and Obscure."

So now with the rules outta da way, describe Knoxville in six words in a comment:
