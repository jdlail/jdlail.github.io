![Thumbnail image for Bill Tallent](/assets-c/2011/03/billtallent-thumb-150x225-630.webp)Bill Tallent, CEO of iPad and smartphone developer Mercury Intermedia, has published some thoughts for news executives on the disruptions they are facing.  
  
> Having built 30+ high-volume, high-visibility touch screen news apps for 14 behemoth print and television media organizations, apps that have been downloaded 20 million times and yield over 1� billion user sessions per year, our experiences lead us to suggest three things that will help news organizations decipher this disruption and "skate to where the puck is going."  
>
> First: Consider what consumers seek.  
>
> Second: Realize that apps are diminishing the role of printing presses  
>
> Third: News industry business models must change

It includes a lot of great information on [tablets, touch  computing, the iPad, the iPhone and Android devices](https://www.mercuryintermedia.com/downloads/bill/20110401FreedomForum2.pdf).
