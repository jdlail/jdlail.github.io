> "It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to know that arsenic is not good for you," said Rep. Frank Niceley, the bill's sponsor.

\-- Tenn. Rep. Frank Niceley in an [AP story](https://www.knoxnews.com/kns/state/article/0,1406,KNS_348_4524797,00.html)  
Niceley, a lawmaker from East Tennessee, was speaking in favor of his bill in the Tennessee Legislature to ban the sale of chickens that have been fed arsenic.  It leaves me to wonder what ones needs a "rocket surgeon" for ... or how you become one?
