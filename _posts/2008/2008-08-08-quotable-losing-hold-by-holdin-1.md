> "What's long held back the newspaper industry and gotten it in the current mess has been holding back online innovation that might impact the legacy product (print). The kind of serious innovation that might have avoided the turmoil we're now seeing among newspapers (especially larger metros like the Inquirer) could only take place with an attitude of "Let's completely forget about the print edition and just try to build the best damn online service possible."

> "But the industry didn't do that, for the most part, instead settling for incremental innovation that wouldn't upset things too much on the legacy side. That's exactly the thinking that's in this Inquirer memo."

\-- Steve Outing [responding](https://steveouting.com/2008/08/07/dont-go-backward-newspapers/) to a memo by the Philadelphia Inquirer's managing editor about what content will be held for print.  

[Jeff Jarvis](https://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/08/07/a-stake-through-the-heart-of-the-has-been-inquirer/) had a quick reaction as well to the memo.
