From [Images](https://www.gizoogle.com/funnyimages.php) on Gizoogle... Lauren passed this one along as a fun site ... and it is: [www.gizoogle.com](https://www.gizoogle.com) (language warning). Course it was created by a guy -- John Beatty -- who's from the hinterlands of York, Pa., not exactly Snoop Dog song territory, but he calls it a tribute to the Snoop Dog. See story in his [local paper](https://ydr.com/story/main/61331/). And in the sad but true department: Google had the York Daily Record article index, but the paper's Web site didn't. Who ate our lunch?
