Just got a copy of [Mark Briggs](https://www.journalism20.com/blog "Mark Briggs")' latest book [Journalism Next: A Practical Guide to Digital Reporting and Publishing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604265604?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1604265604)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1604265604).  
  
Some of efforts we have been doing at the Knoxville News Sentinel are highlighted.  
  
He visited Knoxville during his research for the book. In fact, the book has a bit of a Knoxville flavor. In addition to some people at the News Sentinel, Briggs recognizes [Patrick Beeson](https://patrickbeeson.com/ "Patrick Beeson") of the Knoxville-based E.W. Scripps Interactive Newspaper Group (SING) and [Jim Stovall](https://www.facebook.com/JPROF "Jim Stovall") of the University of Tennessee in the acknowledgments.  
  
Briggs is a frequent presenter at journalism and media conferences and previously wrote "Journalism 2.0: How to Survive and Thrive."  
  
In this book, a cookbook of sorts of journalism and technology, Briggs tries to help readers connect the dots between technology and digital concepts and tools to the core principles of good journalism.  
  
He does a good job. Give it a read.
