Survived upgrade. Still tweeking. Moved blog and blog feeds to root of www.jacklail.com. Users should be automaitcally redirected. Feeds should update. Most difficult part was updating the templates. I finally found it easy to "export" the blog entries, delete the blog and re-import them into a new blog by old name.
