[![Twitter](/images/twitterpng-thumb-260x168.webp)](/images/twitterpng.webp)Just one of things that is interesting about [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/) is how many services have been built upon its simple interface to provide additional  features. For a service that has yet to hit mainstream, it's germinated a whole eco-system of apps.  
  
Here's some of the Twitter tools I like best.  
  
I don't bother with desktop apps or Firefox plugins, but these I find useful.  
  
[TwitterLocal](https://www.twitterlocal.net/), see what folks around the Hood are saying.  
[TweetScan](https://www.tweetscan.com/), search keywords. Or search you user name and see what others have said about you that you might have missed.  
[TweetStats](https://www.tweetstats.com/), all kinds of stats about your Twitter use. I Tweet most often on Saturdays and at 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. I talk to [@Newscoma](https://twitter.com/newscoma) a lot.  
[Summize](https://summize.com/), another great Twitter searching tool.  
[Twitterholic](https://twitterholic.com/), if you need Twitter "friends" to follow.  
[Twist](https://twist.flaptor.com/), Compare keywords. Here's "[big brown and belles](https://twist.flaptor.com/?gram=big+brown%2Cbelles&submit=Show+trends)."  
[TwitterFeed](https://twitterfeed.com/), great RSS to Twitter app.  
[Who Should I follow?](https://www.whoshouldifollow.com/), an interesting one to find new friends on Twitter.  
  
Do you have "must haves?"
