Woohoo, I got an email this morning that this blog had been named one of the Top 100 Journalism blogs by [The Daily Reviewer](https://thedailyreviewer.com/top/journalism), which I wasn't familiar with, ~~but which seems to be a Web title of Times-Shamrock Communications in Pennsylvania.~~ Whoops. It appears to have been created by [Azure Web Design](https://www.crunchbase.com/company/azure-web-design) in the Philippines. (Thanks, Kathy!)  
  
It's a nice aggregator of blogs, similar to Alltop.com, of which this blog is also included in the [journalism category](https://journalism.alltop.com/).  
  
Try both of 'em out.
