Geez, I'm it. Thanks, Jay. That's viral. Jay Small posted his [five things you don't know about me](https://smallinitiatives.com/2006/12/19/blog-tag-5-things-you-dont-know-about-me/) and has passed it on. He'd been tagged by [Greg Sterling](https://gesterling.wordpress.com/2006/12/19/blog-tag-5-things-you-dont-know-about-me/), who'd been tagged by ... well, you get it. I notice [Susan Mernit](https://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2006/12/blog-tag-5-thing-you-dont-know-about.html) is playing, too. She has a link to a [bit of history on blog tag](https://www.soloseo.com/blog-tag-tree.html). It's one of those "aw, what the heck" things that burn through the Internet from time-to-time. So, aw what the heck, here's five from me: 1) The only thing I was first at in high school was in the first class to graduate from the high school (South West Randolph which had just opened). 2) I actually have been to [WhyNot](https://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=55250) and back, as well as [Erect](https://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lon=-79.6875&lat=35.5625) and [Climax](https://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=19202). 3) Lail is a German surname for most people of European descent, but it also is the Arabic word for "night." A chapter of the Koran is Al-Lail, or The Night. 4) Until adulthood, I was known by the nickname of Jackie. My family still calls me by that name -- sometimes. 5) Much to my baseball card collecting son's amazement, I blithely used all sort of now valuable baseball cards as noisemakers in the spokes of my bicycle. First lost fortune, no doubt. My fire line: The viral stops here. Tags: [blog tag](https://technorati.com/tag/blog+tag)
