OMG, somebody did a video that looks just like story comments.  
  
[Eric Berlin](https://onlinemediacultist.com/2008/04/18/lollerskates-reign-at-the-commenter-business-meeting/) pointed to this video last week that I hadn't seen. As he says: "This was produced last fall but is definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it. Think of it as what Slate refers to as Internet commenting as its own "special form of social idiocy" made flesh."  
  
Meanwhile, Kurt Greenbaum has done a number of posts on story comments in last month. They are worth the read:  
  
* [Anonymous comments: Where readers, editors disagree](https://www.igreenbaum.com/2008/04/anonymous-comments-where-readers-editors-disagree/)
* [Dealing with comments: Yelp's best practices](https://www.igreenbaum.com/2008/04/dealing-with-comments-yelps-best-practices/)
* [Advice for businesses dealing with reader comments](https://www.igreenbaum.com/2008/03/advice-for-businesses-dealing-with-reader-comments/)
* [Rebutting the arguments against story commenting](https://www.igreenbaum.com/2008/03/rebutting-the-arguments-against-story-commenting/)
