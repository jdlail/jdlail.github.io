I have always thought the only good purpose of the red "message waiting" light is as a night light for the phone so I particularly enjoyed Gina Trapani's little post on "[The inefficiency of voicemail](https://lifehacker.com/software/voicemail/the-inefficiency-of-voicemail-183735.php)." The Guardian's [Charles Arthur](https://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1802540,00.html) got her cranked up and he has a great rant on one of the truly evil manifestations of technology:

> That's the real killer about voicemail: it takes much longer to deal with the voicemail than the original message. People ramble. They say their phone number veryquicklyindeedinonebreath. They mumble. They use phones that seem to be located underwater. It's all wasted time.

And I agree, forget the voicemail, just send me an email. Tags: [voice mail](https://technorati.com/tag/voice mail) | [telephony](https://technorati.com/tag/telephony) | [voice mail](https://technorati.com/tag/voicemail)
