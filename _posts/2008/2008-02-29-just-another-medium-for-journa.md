Anil Dash of blog software house Six Apart on Joshua Micah Marshall and his [Talking Points Memo](https://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/) wining a prestigious George Polk Award for Legal Reporting: It was the first time an internet only news service had won this journalism prize.  
  
> At Six Apart, we've always believed that blogs are nothing more, and nothing less, than a new medium, native to the web and nimbler than the ones that preceded it. That means that, even though people have been falsely debating "blogs vs. journalism" for the better part of a decade, the truth has always been that this is just another medium in which a great journalist can do great work.

Apart from the self-congratulatory PR on the blogging platform, Dash [makes a a good point](https://www.movabletype.com/blog/2008/02/talking-points-memo-a-blog-jou.html).
