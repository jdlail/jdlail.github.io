Thanks to [Mark Potts](https://recoveringjournalist.typepad.com/recovering_journalist/2007/05/no_trees_were_h.html) for pointing to [Iowahawk's Subscribe Now!](https://iowahawk.typepad.com/iowahawk/2007/05/subscribe_now_1.html). And to NewTeeVee's Liz Gannes for [pointing](https://newteevee.com/2007/05/08/editors-pick-good-morning-world/) to [Good Morning World](https://www.goodmorningworld.com/). Iowahawk has the history of the newspapers satirically nailed. And Andy Peppers (played by Peter Oldring) and Alasdair Coulter (played by Pat Kelly) are indeed a "bad morning show for the world." Together, they were a great way to start the day. Check them out. Tags: [newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/newspapers) | [TV morning shows](https://technorati.com/tag/tv morning shows)
