Gee, even I should of have thought of [this](https://umbrellatoday.com/). Some newspaper geek should have. Some newspaper vendor should have. Heck, some econ major smart enough to hack Sarah Palin's email should have.  
  
I think Mark "Rizzn" Hopkins is [right](https://mashable.com/2008/09/24/umbrella-today/). It'll make a million because it strips down its product offering to the ONE job to be done: tell me if it's going to rain.  
  
Am I wrong?
