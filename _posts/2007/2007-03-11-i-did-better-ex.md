I did better exercising this week than [last week](/2007/03/missed-my-goal.html). A coworker ragged me a bit about not putting last week's in a table. So this week I didn't use a table either, but I did use CSS. I've created a new category to track this: [fatblogging](/fatblogging/).     **Sessions**  
**Calories burned**  
**Time exercising**  
**Miles jogged/eliptical**  
   
**Actual**
