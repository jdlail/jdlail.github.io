Interesting stats [MediaPost](https://www.mediapost.com/blogs/research_brief/index.php?p=1842) pulled from a study presented at the [Society for New Communications Research Symposium](https://www.newcommreview.com/?p=1368) on Nov. 14, 2008:  
  
* 87% of 18-29 year-olds believe bloggers have become important opinion-shapers, versus 60% of 50-64 year-olds
* 87% of 18-29 year-olds confirm that new media and communications enhances the relationship with their audience, versus 42% of 50-64 year-olds
* 48% of all respondents use LinkedIn, and 45% use Facebook to assist in reporting
* 68% of all respondents use blogs to keep up on issues or topics of interest
* 86% of all respondents use company websites, 71% use Wikipedia, and 46% use blogs to research an individual organization

It is a fairly small survey of 160 journalists but it is [continuing](https://www.surveytracker.net/scripts/survey.dll?AHID=03100D) if you'd like to participate. See the [PowerPoint](https://sncr.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/sncr-2nd-inc-pres-1108.ppt) of the symposium presentation on the study. The key finding is, _duh!,  _ "Millennial Generation" journalists are comfortable with social media and have adopted it as a tool for newsgathering and as a source for news.  
  
But for PR folks pitching a story to journalists, email, phone and face-to-face meetings are still tops.
