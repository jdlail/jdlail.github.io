As a Twitter user, if someone follows me, I like to return the favor and follow them. If it looks like a spammer (and my test is they are following 5,000 plus people, but only 39 people are follow them), I do pass.

But one in my morning mailbox from RU4Real did make me laugh.

So far [RU4Real](https://twitter.com/RU4Real) is following 2,427 people and has 37 followers.

The most recent message:

>  DO NOT FOLLOW THIS ACCOUNT. It is part of an experiment to see how many people actually read the pages of the people they follow.

Now that's different. If her photo was larger, I suspect teh experiment would be more _successful_.

Feel free to [follow me](https://twitter.com/jacklail). I'm real, but I make no guarantees as to whether I'm interesting.
