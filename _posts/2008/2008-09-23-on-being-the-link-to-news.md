Scott Karp, founder of [Publish2](https://publish2.com/), explains the power of "link journalism" using a roundup of Vol coverage we did Monday.  
  
The concept is so counter-intuitive (create outbound links to generate inbound traffic) that news sites for years were loath to link out, particularly to competitors. But as Karp [notes](https://publishing2.com/2008/09/22/link-journalism-in-action-vols-game-coverage-roundup-most-viewed-and-commented-on-govolsxtracom/):  
  
> By rounding up all of the coverage from around the web using LINKS, Knoxnews created a DESTINATION for fans to discuss the game.

And the people being linked to [seem to like it](https://volball.wordpress.com/2008/09/23/big-thank-you/) as well.  
  
As Karp asks: _And you're not doing it... why?_
