This must rank just behind a Paris sighting among celebrity watchers. While the paparazzi didn't get his photo, journalism professor and blogger Bryan Murley cornered Will Sullivan of exclusive Palm Beach for an [online interview](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/blog/2007/06/27/icm-interview-will-sullivan-aka-the-journerdist/). Sullivan on blogging:

> My blog format evolved out of basically trying to save my sanity. I started off in the traditional format, doing a topical posts daily, but I really got addicted to RSS feeds. (I currently subscribe to 986 feeds.) And keeping up on those at least semi-daily takes a lot of time. So I couldn’t do that, post links and the longer topical diatribes and make sure I had clean clothes and a functioning car at the same time. So now I do the digests and little bits of opinion/snark with sparse topical posts.

And, of course, read Sullivan's [blog](https://www.journerdism.com/). Tags: [Will Sullivan](https://technorati.com/tag/will sullivan) | [Innovation in College Media](https://technorati.com/tag/Innovation in College Media)
