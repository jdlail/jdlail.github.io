[![fax machine](/images/offwiththefax-thumb.webp)](/images/offwiththefax.webp)2007 is the year the facsimile machine [died](https://webworkerdaily.com/2007/06/12/is-it-time-to-ditch-the-fax-number/)? Not everyone [agrees](https://jyte.com/cl/fax-machines-are-an-antiquated-technology-that-just-wont-die). I still have a fax machine on my desk, but it startled me when it rang the other day. I do have some regular junk faxers, which like cockroaches, will probably outlive the end of the earth, but other than that, I think I receive something I actually need to have about once every five or six months. I could live without it. The newspaper and the newsroom still get a lot of information via fax. Says something about the industry. Says something about PR folks, too.
