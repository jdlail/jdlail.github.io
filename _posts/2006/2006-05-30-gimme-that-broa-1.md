**Tags:** [Broadband](https://technorati.com/tag/broadband) | [New Media](<https://technorati.com/tag/New> Media) | [Media](https://technorati.com/tag/media) | [Technology](https://technorati.com/tag/technology) The [Pew Internet & American Life](https://www.pewinternet.org/) folks released late last week their latest [Broadband survey](https://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Broadband_trends2006.pdf) and it's got some really interesting findings. The headline: Broadband adoption grew by 40 percent in the past year with the Telcos the winners.  Among the survey's finding:

* Home broadband adoption grew by 40% in the year prior to March 2006, twice the growth rate of the year before.
* Growth in broadband adoption has been very strong in middle-income households, and particularly fast for African Americans and those with low levels of education.
* 3% of online users saying they use a VoIP service at home. VoIP awareness has shot up 86% since early 2004.
