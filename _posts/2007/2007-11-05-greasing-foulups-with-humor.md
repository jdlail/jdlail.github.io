It's certainly not how it would be done by the corporate book, but I like a sense of humor when things screw up with computers as they will and do. Here's an example from over the weekend from the [Feedburner blog](https://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2007/11/sunday_subscriber_count_drop.php):  
  
> Saturday Subscriber Count Drop?  
>
> If you saw your subscriber count drop precipitously in your Saturday, November 3rd summary from FeedBurner, the reason is that specific subscriber stats from Google Feedfetcher were offline because this service was apparently out late with friends on Friday night, and well, it completely slept through Saturday. It appears to have rallied, however, and amid firm declarations of "I'm never doing that again", Feedfetcher has started diligently reporting subscriber numbers to us, early this morning Pacific Time. FeedBurner publishers' subscriber counts should be closer to what you'd normally expect starting with reports that will be available on Monday morning.

Of course, they aren't talking about my bank account -- or even my broadband account. What's the best explanation you've seen of service issues?
