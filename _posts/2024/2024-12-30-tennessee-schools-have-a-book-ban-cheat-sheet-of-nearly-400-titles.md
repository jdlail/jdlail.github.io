A list of some [390 books banned earlier this school year](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/wilson-county-schools-ban-books/article_b7fe2ce4-931d-11ef-af84-ffafa967f7a6.html) by school officials in one Tennessee county is being used as a "cheat sheet" by other school districts to vet their assessment of which books to ban.

The list originated in Wilson County, which includes the towns of Mt. Juliet and Lebanon in Middle Tennessee, and is being circulated to other school systems in the state studying how to comply with the state's "age-appropriate" school library law.

Chalkbeat's Marta Aldrich, who has extensively reported on school book banning in Tennessee, wrote earlier this month that a survey found that [1,100 books have been banned](https://www.chalkbeat.org/tennessee/2024/12/11/textbook-commission-still-waiting-on-first-school-library-book-appeal/) by Tennessee school systems in the first few months of the school year and hundreds more have been banned since.

The escalation in book bans follows an expansion this year of Tennessee's controversial [2022 Age-Appropriate Materials Act](https://www.aclu-tn.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/age-appropriate_materials_one-pager_0.pdf).

## Growing Trend of Book Bans

In July 2023, Tennessee [ranked 4th in the number of books banned](https://jacklail.com/2023/07/more-than-340-books-banned-in-tennessee-public-schools/) by school districts.

Nationally, PEN America says it tracked [10,046 instances of book bans](https://pen.org/report/beyond-the-shelves/) during the last school year, nearly four times the number of book bans just two years before. The bans involved over 4,000 titles.

PEN America, a non-profit which has been around since 1922, works to defend free expression.

For a number of authors, their entire catalog is being targeted, according to PEN America.

## Role of Moms for Liberty

The conservative group [Moms for Liberty](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/us/moms-for-liberty-scandal-opposition/index.html) spearheads the book ban effort in schools. The organization started in Florida in 2021 protesting COVID-19 restrictions in schools and latched onto education materials and books in schools. The group has spread across the country with local chapters in at least 45 states.

Moms for Liberty has been very active in Tennessee -- especially Middle Tennessee -- frequenting school board meetings, lobbying for legislation and supporting conservative candidates who support its views. In 2021, in one of its earliest book banning efforts in the state, the group tried to ban a book about Martin Luther King Jr. because teaching [the history of civil rights has "traumatized" white children](https://www.salon.com/2021/11/30/right-wing-moms-group-wants-to-use-tennessees-critical-race-theory-law-to-ban-mlk-jr-book/).

The effort, however, to remove supposedly obscene and pornographic books from school libraries caught fire with conservatives and has become a popular cause among a variety of conservative groups and politicians.

"The restrictions on books and access to authors, stories, and information are today having far-reaching implications," PEN America writes in the report "[Banned in the USA: Beyond the Shelves](https://pen.org/report/beyond-the-shelves/). "In the third year of this worsening book banning crisis, the defense of the core principles of public education and the freedom to read, learn, and think is as necessary now as ever."

What happens to books banned by school systems in Tennessee? “[I don’t have a clue, but I would burn ’em](https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/04/27/representative-says-he-would-burn-books-deemed-inappropriate-by-state/#:~:text=State%20Rep.,to%20the%20commission%2C%20state%20Rep.)," one rural East Tennessee legislator said in 2022.
