The value of video conferencing on the cheap was demonstrated Sunday when the Society of Professional Journalists president used her Macbook to do a video conference at an event of the society's East Tennessee chapter in Knoxville.

From SPJ president Christine Tatum's [blog](https://www.spj.org/blog/blogs/president/archive/2007/09/12/8526.aspx):

> On Sunday afternoon, I visited with SPJ members in Knoxville, Tenn. While sitting in my home. In Denver. I even got a chance to show off my 2-year-old daughter, Tatum Elizabeth, who insisted on saying, "Hi, Tennessee!"  

John Huotari of the Oak Ridger and president of SPJ's East Tennessee chapter, said "helped open our eyes to some other opportunities."

Tatum it "was a thrilling moment in the history of this organization."
