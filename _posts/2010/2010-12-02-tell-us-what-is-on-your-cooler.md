[Deadspin](https://deadspin.com/5704435/how-pat-summitt-ruined-the-best-thing-about-womens-basketball) says University of Tennessee women's basketball coach [Pat Summitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Summitt "Pat Summitt") practice of always going by the book and doing what is right makes her "utterly insufferable."  
  
She said at the team's Media Day a few weeks ago: "I've never compromised at all, and I wouldn't. And if I did, they should fire me." That's Pat Summitt and that's how she rolls. But Deadspin is not satisfied and wrote:

> After the media day comment, Jimmy Hyams at Knoxville's WNML asked her to clarifyher remarks. Some believed she was taking a dig at her Tennessee colleague. "I didn't have [Bruce Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Pearl "Bruce Pearl") on my mind," Summitt explained. "I probably had Connecticut on my mind. There's a reason we don't play them." Maybe this was a bad joke. But it reads as airy condescension, with no context or explanation given, and that's a good way to stir up an over-stirred debate.

> It's unclear, really, what Summitt believes [Auriemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geno_Auriemma "Geno Auriemma") is guilty of. UConn self-reported the only known NCAA infringement in its women's program's history, when then-recruit [Maya Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Moore "Maya Moore") was given a tour of the [ESPN](https://espn.go.com/tvlistings/networks/espnnow.html "ESPN") headquarters in Bristol in October 2005 ([ESPN then self-reported the story](https://sports.espn.go.com/ncw/news/story?id=3289808). How meta!). It was deemed a secondary violation. Perhaps Summitt (who lost out to Auriemma in the recruiting battle for two-time Player of the Year Moore) just can't let that go. It was cheating. It was unfair. Where could she have brought Moore in Knoxville -- the _News Sentinel_ mailroom?

[The News Sentinel](https://www.fortwayne.com/mld/newssentinel/ "The News-Sentinel") building is not as cool to visit as the ESPN headquarters in Bristol? OK, I'll grant you, the News Sentinel building is not a hot spot in Knoxville even on Coffee Friday at SING (Scripps Interactive Newspaper Group).  
  
But touring Dollywood arm-in-arm with Dolly Parton would be. There are lots of things to do in Knxoville that would be more fun. What's on your "Cooler than a Visit to ESPN Headquarters" list?
