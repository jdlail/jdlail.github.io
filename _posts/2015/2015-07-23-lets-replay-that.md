[![ICD-UX533](/assets_c/2015/07/sony-voice-recorder-thumb-200xauto-2533.webp)](/images/sony-voice-recorder.webp)Still like a voice recorder for capturing interviews instead of a smartphone?

But don't know what to buy?

[The Wirecutter](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-voice-recorder/) may have done the evaluation for you. This week, the site recommended the Sony ICD-UX533 as its pick for "best voice recorder" (just $78 from B&H Photo) The site's criteria was the voice recorder had to cost under a $100.  
  
They trimmed a pool of dozens of recorders down to eight that were looked at closely. Of those, the Sony model was the pick.  
  
Take a look at what it said and how it tested.
