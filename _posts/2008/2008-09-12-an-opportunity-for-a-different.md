![projectreport.jpg](/images/projectreport.webp)YouTube has announced an [ambitious journalism contest](https://www.youtube.com/projectreport) for "citizen journalists." I suspect this contest will produce some powerful pieces.  
  
> In partnership with the Pulitzer Center, YouTube presents Project: Report, a journalism contest (made possible by Sony VAIO & Intel) intended for non-professional, aspiring journalists to tell stories that might not otherwise be told.  
>
> In each of the three rounds, reporters will be given an assignment to complete. Winners of each round will receive technology prizes from Sony VAIO & Intel, and the grand prize winner will be granted a $10,000 journalism fellowship with the Pulitzer Center to report on a story abroad.  
>

Olivia Ma, News Manager for YouTube News & Politics, says the assignment for Round One is a profile of three minutes or less of someone in the contestant's community to highlight a story that deserves to be heard by a wide audience.  
  
(I don't really like the term "citizen journalists" and I noticed YouTube doesn't use it anywhere in explaining this contest,)
