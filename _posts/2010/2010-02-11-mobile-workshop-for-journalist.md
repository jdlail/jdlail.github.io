This is about a workshop a committee I'm on has been working on for a couple months. We'll be releasing our speakers soon (and it's a great list). We have received critical sponsorship support from the [Scripps Howard Foundation](https://www.scripps.com/foundation/) and [CellJournalist Inc.](https://www.celljournlistinc.com/)  
  
The workshop is a joint effort of the [Online News Association](https://journalists.org/?) and the [Freedom Forum](https://www.freedomforum.org/) that we hope will be an attractive one-day training opportunity for journalists in Tennessee, the border states and beyond.  
  
Working on this project have been Patrick Beeson of the Scripps Interactive Newspaper Group in Knoxville, Cory Haik of the Online News Association and The Seattle Times, Val Hoeppner of the Freedom Forum, Jack Marsh of the Freedom Forum, Jane McDonnell of the Online News Association, Ken Sands of the Online News Association, Sherry Salko of the Online News Association, Knight Stivender of The Tennessean, Tracey Trumbull of the Chattanooga Times Free Press and myself.  
  
Again, mark your calendar for April 9.
