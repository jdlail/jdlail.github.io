One of the best CDs I brought recently is [G. Love's](https://www.philadelphonic.com/main.asp) "Lemonade." Released Aug. 1, 2006, it's a collection of really nice tunes with a host of guest musicians including Ben Harper, Marc Broussard, Jack Johnson (the CD is on Johnson's Brushfire Records), Tristan Prettyman, Blackalicious. Philly-based hip/hop bluesman Garrett "G. Love" Dutton (who one reviewer calls "one of the premier purveyors of a funky fusion of sparkling acoustic pop, white-boy rap, and ragged blues" .. whew, whatever) has one nice CD. I'll think I'll be listening to it for quite awhile. Here's the track list: 1\. Ride 2\. Ain't That Right 3\. Hot Cookin' 4\. Can't Go Back to Jersey 5\. Missing My Baby 6\. Holla! 7\. Banger - Blackalicious, G. Love, Lateef the Truth Speaker 8\. Thanks and Praise - G. Love, 9\. Let the Music Play - Marc Broussard, G. Love, 10\. Free 11\. Beautiful - G. Love, Tristan Prettyman 12\. Rainbow - G. Love, Jack Johnson 13\. Breakin' Up 14\. Still Hanging' Around/Sneakster 15\. Love
