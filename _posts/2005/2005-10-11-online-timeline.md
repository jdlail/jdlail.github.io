Noticed this link in the Online-News email this morning. David Carlson has a comprehensive [Online Timeline](https://iml.jou.ufl.edu/carlson/timeline.shtml). Worth bookmarking! A couple entries: 1969 -- CompuServe Information Service launches in Columbus, Ohio, as a computer time-sharing service. 1974 -- First Use of term "Internet" appears in a conference paper by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn. 1980 -- Pac-Man, a successful video game, is released. 1992 -- Newspaper Association of America reports 11 newspapers have an online presence in the U.S. and Canada and more than 250 offer voice information services. 2004 -- Jan. 20: Apple's 4-gigabyte iPod Mini is released and sells well. Dave, a professor at the University of Florida, is one of the pioneers in news online. Thanks for a great timeline to keep it all straight!
