Everybody's looking for next the innovation, be it an online product or the latest in dried pulp. That's why I loved David Hornik's [post](https://p6.hostingprod.com/@ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2006/001231.html)on on his son's fledgling concept. Yeah, it's cute, but I also noticed:

  1. It didn't take endless meetings.
  2. He made decisions.
  3. It happened fast.
I believe we could learn a thing or two from his entrepreneurship. Even if he never sells more than two bucks of his "skate brand," he's thinking the right way at an early age.
