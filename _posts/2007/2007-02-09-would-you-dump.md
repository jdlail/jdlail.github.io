Two interesting takes on Google Docs: [Charlene Li](https://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2007/02/how_i_use_googl.html) and [Scott Karp](https://publishing2.com/2007/02/09/top-ten-things-that-suck-about-google-docs/). Obviously, Google Docs aren't as good as Microsoft Office. The question is are they good enough -- or how long will it take to make them good enough. For home managing, it appears close for Li, although she finds much to dislike. For Karp, the inability to work on a Google Doc on a plane and its slowness in certain operations are real barriers to adoption. Would you dump office for Google docs?
