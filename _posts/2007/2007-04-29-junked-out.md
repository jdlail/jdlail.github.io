I think I junked out too much last week and I ended up gaining a half pound instead of losing any. Boo! Also exercised one day less than the plan. The hard part is doing it when you're tired or you just don't feel like it or you just don't seem to have the time. I did change it up a bit by doing one session on a recumbent bike. Here's what this week looked like:     **Sessions****Calories burned** **Time exercising** **Miles jogged/stationary  
bike**  **Actual** 3 2264 2:57 16.35  **Target** 4 2000 3:15 No advice   The month-to-date miles is 52.96. Tags: [jogging](https://technorati.com/tag/jogging) | [fatbloggers](https://technorati.com/tag/fatbloggers) | [jason calacanis](https://technorati.com/tag/jason calacanis)
