![Charlie Acuff](/images/0131acuff.webp)Two of my News Sentinel co-workers are doing an interesting and historically significant project called "[Songs of Appalachia](https://web.knoxnews.com/special/songs/)." It is being done by online producer [Lauren Spuhler](https://www.laurenspuhler.com/) and writer Morgan Simmons.  
  
They're capturing the sounds and songs of the region in video and text.  
  
Old-time, bluegrass, folk, just call it roots music in the mountains. It's the unique musical styles and songs that have survived on the back porches, at the Saturday night get-togethers and in the postage stamp communities of the Appalachian Mountains of East Tennessee and North Carolina.  
  
The first installment is on fiddler Charlie Acuff. Each month will bring a new musician. Bookmark the page! Amazing stuff.
