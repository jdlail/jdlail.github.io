[ShermansTravel.com's](https://travel.msn.com/Guides/article.aspx?cp-documentid=748043&page=3) list the Great Smoky Mountains National Park as one of the "29 Places to Go in 2009."  
  
> **Why go in 2009:** With American travelers forecasted to plan more trips to national parks this year, the Great Smoky Mountains offer one of the country's most cost-efficient vacations in the great outdoors. Admission to the park is always completely free, and as this year marks the 75th anniversary of its founding ([www.greatsmokies75th.org](https://greatsmokies75th.org/welcome-to-the-great-smokies-75th/)), many additional complimentary activities are planned, including musical performances and special ranger-led programs.
