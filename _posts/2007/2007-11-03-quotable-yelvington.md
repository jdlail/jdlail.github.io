\-- [Steve Yelvington](https://www.yelvington.com/20071103/what_newspapers_need_do_about_opensocial)  
  
Yelvington makes a compelling case for an "and strategy" in viewing social networks as platforms for newspaper-type content. He notes: _One of the most interesting, Neighborhoods, is being used by a company that runs a real estate listing website to slip their listings into Facebook space. Think about that for a minute._  
  
And earlier this week, Rob Curley, in [announcing](https://robcurley.com/2007/11/01/the-washingtonpostcom-newstracker-for-facebook/) the Washington Post's [newsTracker](https://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=5660157662), fleshed out some of the business reasons he sees in Facebook applications (a small slice of a huge audience).  
  
A colleague last week dismissed Facebook apps as not worth the development time because there is "no business model." Perhaps. I can remember when Google had no business model ... and today [GOOG](https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/ibd.morningstar.com/quicktake/standard/client/shell/AP707.html?CN=AP707&valid=NO&set=new&view=quote&ticker=goog&SITE=TNKNN&SECTION=MONEY_COMPLETE&TEMPLATE=). And I've heard it said I'm working in an industry with no future business model. _Hmm_.  
  
The photo is of part of the Chiswell Islands in the Gulf of Alaska and is a National Ocean Service, NOAA photo.
