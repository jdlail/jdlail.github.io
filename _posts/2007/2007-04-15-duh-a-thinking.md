[![thinkingbloggerpf8.jpg](/images/thinkingbloggerpf8.webp)](https://www.knoxviews.com/node/4310) Whoa, been tagged by none other than [Randy Neal](https://www.knoxviews.com/node/4310) in the Thinking Blogger Awards. My mamma would be proud. Here's five. 1) [Mathew Ingram](https://www.mathewingram.com/work/), technology writer for the Toronto Globe and Mail. He's always interesting, such as with this [one](https://www.mathewingram.com/work/2007/04/14/twitter-ustream-how-much-is-too-much/) on Robert Scoble and Chris Pirillo experimenting with Ustream and Twiter. 2) Bob Sutton's [Work Matters](https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/). Hey, a college professor should make you think, right? He's got a lot of good advice and interesting research and ask him a question and more likely than not, he'll answer it. In this one, he points to an [online article](https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/04/mckinsey_quarte.html) he recently wrote. 3) Ex-Scrippser and now a Gatehouse Guy, [Howard Owens](https://www.howardowens.com/) is a prolific blogger who's not wishy-washy when it comes to [opinions](https://www.howardowens.com/2007/journalists-need-to-be-entrepreneurial/). 4) He's been parrying or partying with Yahoo too much lately to be blogging, methinks, but my sole homie pick is Jay Small's [Small Initiatives](https://smallinitiatives.com/). I liked this [recent post](https://smallinitiatives.com/2007/03/02/making-innovation-work-at-newspapers/). (That's not say there's not a lot of thought-provoking homies hereabouts; there are.) 5) I find [Eric Berlin](https://onlinemediacultist.com/) always a good read. Saturday's post was on [blog strategy](https://onlinemediacultist.com/2007/04/14/on-blog-networks-and-blog-strategy/). So there, five tagged. They've probably been tagged earlier, but anyway Sunday morning fun. It's definitely random because almost every blog I read on a regular basis makes me think -- or tells me something I didn't know. Da rules (as I understand them) for the Thinking Blog Award:

  1. If, and only if, you get tagged, write a post with links to 5 blogs that make you think,
  2. Link to this post so that people can easily find the exact origin of the meme,
  3. Optional: Proudly display the 'Thinking Blogger Award' with a link to the post that you wrote (here is an alternative [silver version](https://img201.imageshack.us/img201/421/thinkingblogger2ql6.jpg) if [gold](https://img255.imageshack.us/img255/5020/thinkingbloggerpf8.jpg) doesn't fit your blog).

I believe this particular [blog memetag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetag) was started by "The Thinking Blog" on [Feb. 11, 2007](https://www.thethinkingblog.com/2007/02/thinking-blogger-awards_11.html) in a blog post where the writer both starts a memetag and promises not to participate in them in the future. Huh? Are these things silly? Why, yes, that's why we do them.
