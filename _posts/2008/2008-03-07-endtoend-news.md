I hadn't heard it put this quite this way, but it's a great way to thinking about a news site:  
  
_Be the first and last word on a story._  
  
That's a slightly re-spun version of something Andy Dickinson [credited earlier this week](https://www.andydickinson.net/2008/03/04/dna2008-day2-multi-platform/) to Ed Roussel, Digital Editor, Telegraph Media Group, It works for me. Roussel also outlined an interesting timeline in the evolution of a breaking story.
