Katie Kolt, one of the knoxnews online producers, has started a blog on knoxnews called "[Linked](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/kolt/)." It's described as discussing "her new ties: to Knoxville, to her fiance and to the 'real world.'" She got engaged in the last couple of weeks and it's sort of about starting life as an adult, first job out of college; living in a new city, getting married. Give it a read. Leave her a comment.
