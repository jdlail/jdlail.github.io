That's the beginning of a [blog post by Gibson](https://tcog.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/free-speech-at-risk-from-tennessee-general-assembly/) on efforts by defense attorneys in a murder trial to prevent The Knoxville News Sentinel from posting public comments on its Web site about their clients and multiple bills in the General Assembly to close access to state gun carry permits, an effort sparked by the posting of the state database of those permits by the Memphis Commercial Appeal.  
  
"It's hard to image any state with two cases of this magnitude going on at the same time," Gibson writes.
