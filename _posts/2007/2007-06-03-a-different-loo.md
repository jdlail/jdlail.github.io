[![HDR photo of a scene in Scotland.](/images/117_6_8_marriott_hdr-thumb.webp)](/images/117_6_8_marriott_hdr.webp) I tried to do some HDR photography while on vacation in Scotland last week. I'd say the results were mixed. I like the one above and there are some more [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/sets/72157600305924279/show/). HDR is "[high dynamic range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDRI)" imaging. I got interested in from looking at some stunning photos from [Bob Benz](https://www.opposable-thumbs.com/), who pointed me in the right direction to learn about it and passed along a few tips. As a total neophyte, I had to learn some options on my [camera](https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d70.htm) I hadn't used. I don't have that all figured out yet. The biggest obstacle to overcome, however, was camera shake. I didn't use a tripod with any of the ones I did. They would have worked a lot better had I had one. HDR involves taking bracketed exposures (I was trying to do three) and any movement of the camera makes the results very blurry or ghostly. In some of mine, I only used two photographs because three looked as if I had been drinking shots of Scottish whiskey between frames. I used [Photmatix Pro](https://www.hdrsoft.com/) to create the images. It's very easy to use. Course, I'm a five-year-old flipping the switches at Mission Control.  Simple! There are a number of [guides and tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=hdr+guides). I think I'll try some of more.
