On track this week. For my Sunday jog, I listened to Gregory Galant do a 49-minute [interview](https://www.venturevoice.com/2007/06/vv_show_46_jeremy_stoppelman_o.html) with Yelp co-founder and president Jeremy Stoppelman. Galant is on a binge of PayPal ex-pats, but, hey, several of them went off with their riches to start interesting new companies, like, say, [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/). For me, jogging is a good opportunity for multitasking, whether it's listening to music or just thinking. Stoppelman was a pretty good listen for a Sunday mid-day jog. Biggest challenge with Yelp: "Not screwing it up." How to scale the business: "The short answer is we don't quite know." Refreshing frankness. If you're into business profiles (granted that sounds geeky), Galant is a good listen, but he doesn't post a new podcast often.
