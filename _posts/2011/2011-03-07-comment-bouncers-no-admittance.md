The introduction of the new Facebook comment plugin and the legal efforts to force the Indianapolis Star to disclose information it may have on anonymous commenters makes it a salient time to post an updated list of comments links.  
  
These are part of a collection of links on delicious about [comments on websites](https://www.delicious.com/jacklail/comments), particularly news websites. I hope you find them helpful. There are also some previous posts on [comments](/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=tag%3DComments&IncludeBlogs=25&limit=75)..
