I'm trying to sell a telephone line switcher (ComSwitch 5500). Works great, but I just don't need it any more. If interested see my eBay auction [here](https://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5854999399&rd=1&sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&rd=1). I'm also trying to sell two Palm Tungsten T cradles and a hardcase (the screen on the Palm just quit working). This is for the T, not the T2. Click [here](https://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5851587172&rd=1&sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&rd=1) to see that auction.
