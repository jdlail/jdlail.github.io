This is a barn at what was the Stanley family homeplace, where my grandmother grew up in Southwest Virginia. I took it, [among others](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/tags/stanley2009/), during a Stanley Reunion this past Sunday at the Caney Fork Baptist Church. This is way back in the hills; here's [a map of the area](https://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&FORM=LMLTCP&cp=37.09%7E-82.38405&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&phx=0&phy=0&phscl=1&cid=9B4891073539B0A1%21117&encType=1).
