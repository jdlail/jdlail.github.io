[![021103_wire_copy_sm.jpg](/assets-c/2008/12/021103-wire-copy-sm-thumb-150x137.webp)](/images/021103_wire_copy_sm.webp)A lot is being written about CNN's intentions on being a wire service to newspapers.  
  
On Twitter yesterday, media strategist and all-around digital news pioneer [Steve Yelvington](https://twitter.com/yelvington/status/1037289651) said:  
  
> Am I supposed to take CNN seriously as a potential newswire? It keeps Lou Dobbs and Nancy Grace, fires Miles O'Brien and sci/tech team.  
>

(More on the [Miles O'Brien layoff](https://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/cnn_cuts_entire_science_tech_t.php).)  
  
Well, there's that. [Doug Page](https://itsfourthandlong.blogspot.com/2008/12/cnn-associated-press-celebrity-death.html) (link via [ejeffreys](https://twitter.com/ejeffreys)) has thoughts on what it'll take to take on the Associated Press on its home turf.  
  
Page defines the AP's business model as:  "extortionary pricing for no or damn little customer service in return and a state report that's as good as what the 'members' contribute because the AP can't be bothered to do much original reporting - is finally obsolete."  
  
But of the prospect of newspapers rising up and bolting, Page says:  
  
> "The newspaper industry is filled with intransigence, which prevents it from taking the actions it needs to take to remain a healthy, viable industry. Newspaper executives will sing CNN's praises publicly, but whether they'll actually sign contracts for the network's news wire is an entirely different matter."
