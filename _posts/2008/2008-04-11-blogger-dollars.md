I didn't know that E.W. Scripps subsidiary (at least until mid-summer) Shopzilla had an ad network for bloggers and other publishers. Problogger has the details on the [Shopzilla Publisher Program](https://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/04/11/exploring-shopzilla-interview/).  
  
[Shopzilla](https://www.shopzilla.com/) is a comparison shopping site.
