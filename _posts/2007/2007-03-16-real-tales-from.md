[![Ilana Arazie](/images/iatightcrop-thumb.webp)](/images/iatightcrop.webp)Beet.tv's Andy Plesser has done a [nice piece](https://www.beet.tv/2007/03/associated_pres.html) on [Ilana Arazie](https://www.ilanadonna.com/), who I mentioned [recently](/2007/02/arazie_asks_how.html). I'm a big fan of Arazie's "[Reel City Tales](https://asapblogs.typepad.com/reel_city_tales)" vblog. We've featured it a couple times on the home page and the entertainment section front of [KnoxNews](https://www.knoxnews.com/) on the weekends and it's gotten pretty good traffic -- for a weekend. She pushing the envelope a bit for content on mainstream media sites. Check out what she has to say on this video itnerview on Beet.tv. Good interview! One wonders when she'll leave her day gig as an AP "Product Specialist" to be a fulltime vblogger for the wire service.
