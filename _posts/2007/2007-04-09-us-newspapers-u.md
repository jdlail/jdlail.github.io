I've discovered ~~five~~ six U.S. newspapers providing headlines on Twitter. They are (with links to their Twitter pages):  
  
* [Chicago Redeye](https://twitter.com/RedEyeChicago)
* [The Knoxville News Sentinel (knoxnews.com)](https://twitter.com/knoxnews)
* [The Nashua Telegraph (nashuatelegraph.com)](https://www.twitter.com/nashuatelegraph)
* [The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://twitter.com/nytimes)
* [The Oregonian (oregonlive.com)](https://twitter.com/oregonian)
* [Spokesman Review (spokesmanreview.com)](https://twitter.com/SpokesmanReview)

Are there others? I'll maintain a list. _LAST UPDATED: April 15, 2007_ [Tweet me](https://www.twitter.com/devanel). Tags: [twitter](https://technorati.com/tag/twitter) | [newspapers](https://technorati.com/tag/newspapers)
