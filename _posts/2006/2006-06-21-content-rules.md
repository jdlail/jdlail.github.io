> The number one thing that newspapers have is that a newspaper throws away more content in a day than [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=YHOO) makes in a year.

\-- [Shawn Riegsecker, CEO of Centro, a Chicago-based media buying firm](https://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&s=44777&Nid=21155&p=268351) Riegsecker was speaking Tuesday at the Newspaper Association of America conference for newspaper investors. The quote was in a story in Online Media Daily from [MediaPost Communications](https://www.mediapost.com/) His point was the biggest advantage newspaper Web sites have over competitors like portal sites is a large amount of quality content that advertisers want to be placed alongside, the article said. Another notable comment in the story was that Tribune Co. said interactive revenues will be $225 million or 6 percent of publishing revenues this year and will be 12 to 15 percent within four years.
