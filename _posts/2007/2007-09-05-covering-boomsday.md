[Boomsday](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/sep/03/summer-goes-out-with-boom/) to those that don't live here is one of the biggest events in Knoxville. People love it. It's always Labor Day weekend. This year it was Sunday night.  
  
Yeah, it was covered by the mainstream media, but how did people (I refuse to use the silly phrase citizen journalists) just creating and sharing their experiences cover it?  
  
I found more than a few examples -- and it's good coverage.  
  
Here's a YouTube video:

There are a [globs of Boomsday videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=search_videos&search_query=boomsday&search_sort=video_date_uploaded&search_category=0&search=Search&v=&uploaded=) on YouTube.

And, again, I found [LOTS more Boomsday photos](https://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=boomsday&m=tags) at flckr.  
  
Of course, there were [bloggers](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=boomsday&ie=UTF-8&scoring=d&sa=N&start=0).  
  
Among them were:

And since Google seems to index Twitter, I even found a few people that had covered it live on [Twitter.com](https://www.twitter.com/) in what some call microblogging.

It doesn't surprise me that people take photos or videos or even blog about an event like Boomsday. It does amaze me how many do that and then go to the trouble of posting it online. Separately, many of these videos, images and blog entries are wonderful accounts; taken together they're a rich, deep chronicling -- or journalism  \-- of the event.  
  
It would be intriguing to wrap these all together to tell the story of the event. And you could today, but you couldn't hours after the fireworks -- or even the day after; either the media and text hadn't been posted or it hadn't been indexed by YouTube or Flickr or ultimately Google. I'm sure a combination of both were at work.  
  
If you could pull together this myriad of coverage, you would have some powerful community journalism. Now that would be fireworks!
