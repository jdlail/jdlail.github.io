[![BlountViews.com](/images/0722blountviews.webp)](https://www.blountviews.com) Knoxville's Randy Neal has spun up a new site, [BlountViews.com](https://www.blountviews.com/), (named for the county, not the blogging ... or maybe both). Its mission is to be _a hyper-local community web space for liberal/progressive citizens of Blount County to meet, organize, and discuss news, politics, events, and issues of interest to the community._ It's cut from the same Drupal-powered mold as his vibrant [KnoxViews.com](https://www.knoxviews.com/). Best of luck with the new site!
