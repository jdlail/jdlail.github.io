But will there really be newspapers when the Chicago Cubs win the World Series?  
  
> What happened with print editions yesterday (Wednesday) was unique because the circumstances were unique. If the Chicago Cubs (ever) win the World Series, you'll likely see a similar run on the Chicago papers. It doesn't mean they're going to see a growth spurt in subscriptions.
