I have to blog this one just so I don't forget where it is. A conference recap set to Jimi Hendrix doing "All Along the Watch Tower." [Watch it](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/blog/2007/04/14/a-thank-you-to-all-nashville-cicmers/).

But it did remind me ... I spent a summer in Seattle (well, Bellevue, actually) in the mid-70s and one weekend we went to Jimi Hendrix's grave site. Below is a photo from the Internet.
