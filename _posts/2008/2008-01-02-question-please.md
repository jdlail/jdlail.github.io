Knoxify, a blog by Brandon Clarke and Casey Peters, [have an innovative way](https://knoxify.com/knox-county-commission-hopefuls-answer-knoxified-questions/) of sorting a passel of local political candidates this election season. Just ask them three rather novel questions on a blog and let them introduce themselves. Easier than hoofing it through a subdivision; less juicy than kissing babies. And you don't need a  governmental policy wonk to craft an answer. (If you do, don't bother answering.)  
  
Here's their plan:  
  
> The upcoming Knox County Commission election has amassed a colossal pool of candidates, many of whom we know nothing about. The Knoxify solution: interview them all and publish their answers unedited. We’re asking all of the candidates to answer the following questions:  
>
>    1\. Introduce yourself to Knoxville, who are you, and why are you running?  
>    2\. We think it’s better knowing what not to do rather than having an extensive plan. What areas or interests would benefit Knox County not to venture into?  
>    3\. What 5 things could you not live without?  
>
> Check back daily to see how the candidates answered our questions.

Who are Clarke and Peters? Well, they co-founded a group called the Young Professionals of Knoxville. Clarke was among the [Greater Knoxville Business Journal's 40 under 40](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/dec/17/40-under-40/). Peters is a project manager at Team Health. They have a cryptic reference to plans for a Ntrospect.com project, but apparently we'll hear about that later.  
  
It'll be interesting --and I hope refreshing -- to see how many of the candidates stop by, say howdy and answer 1-2-3.
