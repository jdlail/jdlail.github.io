I am really surprised to see how the mainstream media is pretty much ignoring the massive flooding in Nashville...[Thu May 06 14:14:31](https://twitter.com/McCainBlogette/status/13489602455 "Thu May 06 14:14:31 ") via web[![](https://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/539323739/img-author-photo---meghan-mccain-_201210377527_normal.jpg)](https://twitter.com/McCainBlogette)**[Meghan McCain](https://twitter.com/McCainBlogette)**

The complaint that the national news media underplayed coverage of the Tennessee flooding and two dozen deaths in Middle and West Tennessee has a familiar ring.  
  
The exact same complaint arose in the wake of the [Tennessee Valley Authority's coal ash catastrophe](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/news/state/tva-pond-breach-roane-county/) at TVA's Kingston steam plant on Dec. 22, 2009. It was a week before national media began to latch onto that story.  
  
And it has been a consistent complaint by some regarding the lack of attention the early January 2007 [murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/news/local/channon-christian-christopher-newsom-murders/) received in the media outside of Tennessee.  
  
Andrew Romano at Newsweek tries to [explain](https://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2010/05/06/why-the-media-ignored-the-nashville-flood.aspx) (but does not fully) why the national media is consistently slow to pick up on major breaking news happening in the U.S. beyond the bright lights of Times Square.  
  
In all three cases, national media attention appeared to come more as a response to the drumbeat of criticism.  
  
Is the hitherland that isolated from America's media nerve centers?
