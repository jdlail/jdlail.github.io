It is great to see a group of people are trying to save Chattanooga's historic [Engel Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_Stadium "Engel Stadium"), the second oldest minor league baseball stadiums in America and one that is on the [National Register of Historic Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places "National Register of Historic Places").  
  
It's an 80-year-old, 5,997-seat monument to baseball history that seems to be locked in a "Twilight Zone" episode of ownership.  
  
I was there in 2008 and took the above HRD photos. It was in bad shape then; I can only imagine what it's like with two more years of  no maintenance and being a haunt of the homeless.  
  
A story in the [Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/mar/12/group-fights-to-save-engel-stadium/?local) today offers a glimmer of hope of saving the park. Its supporters need to be wearing their rally caps.
