Wow, this is how Twitter users covered the storm that damaged the Georgia Dome during the Alabama-Mississippi State game.  
  
This is a [Twittersearch](https://twittermap.com/search?georgia%20dome) result set for "georgia dome." Noticed some people were talking about the weather without using this exact search terms o I've far from caught all the relevant Twitters, but you get the idea of how the news spread among Twitter users.
