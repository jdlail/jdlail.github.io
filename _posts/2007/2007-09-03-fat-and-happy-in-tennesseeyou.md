You may have seen this story last week; it hit the wires last Monday (Aug. 27, 2007).  
  
[Trust for America's Health](https://healthyamericans.org/) released its "F as in Fat" report on obesity rates by state and Tennessee climbed to fifth, tied with South Carolina.  
  
[In Tennessee](https://healthyamericans.org/reports/obesity2007/release.php?StateID=TN), 27.8 percent of the population is considered to be obese.  
  
A [body mass index](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/) greater than 30 is consider obese (I'm probably on the line between overweight and obese unfortunately). Overweight is a BMI of 25 to 29.9 and normal is 18.5 to 24.9.  
  
Here an online [BMI calculator](https://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/) so you ca get a guess of yours.  
  
The survey also that that 30.5 percent do not engage in any physical activity (the national average is 22 percent.).  
  
The duh-huh fact is: A lack of exercise is a huge factor in obesity rates.  
  
The same group has a [set of stats](https://healthyamericans.org/state/index.php?StateID=TN) on the health of Tennesseans.
