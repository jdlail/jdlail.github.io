The coming "watching web."  
  
Writing about a new TV Web site called [livenewscameras.com](https://www.livenewscameras.com/), former Nashville TV station general manager [Mike Sechrist](https://www.mikesechrist.com/uncategorized/265/10265.html) says:  
  
> You want news from your "hometown" from anywhere in the world?  Not a problem, it will be available on the web when you want it. The storms that hit Tennessee and other states on Tuesday night could be watched in real time anywhere with internet access as WKRN, WSMV and WTVF all streamed their coverage to the web.  These are the opening salvos in the tumultuos changes to come.
