It is interesting that Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards seems to be the only candidate attempting to use Twitter as way of communicating with voters. The [Twitter blog](https://twitter.com/blog/2007/07/johnedwards.html) says Edwards will answer Twitters during a live Webcast following the Monday YouTube/CNN debate among the Democratic hopefuls. Edwards' Twitter page is [twitter.com/johnedwards](https://twitter.com/johnedwards), but see the Twitter blog for details. There's some discussion of the YouTube/CNN debate [here](https://hotair.com/archives/2007/07/22/video-glenn-reynolds-and-ana-marie-cox-on-the-cnn-youtube-debate/) and all the official info [here](https://www.youtube.com/debates). Is Twitter an effective platform for creating dialogue and connection to voters or customers, or is it just micro-blogging among friends? It's already obvious that YouTube will be a campaign factor, but Twitter much less so. Edwards is approaching 3,000 Twitters users following his postings, which will get sucked into Google's search results. That's a small number for a nationwide political campaign or any kind of national marketing campaign; he's definitely early to the technology. (I was able today to get knoxnews headlines coming back into Twitter by using [twitterfeed.com](https://twitterfeed.com/). Nice! Follow knoxnews at [twitter.com/knoxnews](https://twitter.com/knoxnews). Ignore the coffin colors.)
