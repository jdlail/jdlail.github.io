Here's a photo of "a bench for Taylor Swift," one of the odder features of the popular Centennial Park in Nashville.

![Plaque on Taylor Swift bench](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-03_15_33_59_IMG_2285-cropped.webp)Plaque on Taylor Swift bench which was dedicated by the City of Nashville in May 2023.

The bench was [unveiled a year ago](https://www.wsmv.com/2023/05/05/nashville-dedicates-bench-taylor-swift-centennial-park/) by then-Mayor John Cooper just before her "Eras" tour shows in Bridgestone Arena.

But there's no reports that Swift's butt has ever used her bench. Nonetheless, it attracts "Swifties" for photos. It's a fan destination, a tourist attraction and a cultural icon.

The bench has a small plaque that reads: “For Taylor Swift, A bench for you to read on at Centennial Park. Welcome home, Nashville.”

The [bench plaque is a reference to the lyric](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-nashville-dedicates-invisible-string-bench-centennial-park-1235322735/) “Green was the color of the grass, Where I used to read at Centennial Park” in the song "Invisible String."

Nice setting, though.
