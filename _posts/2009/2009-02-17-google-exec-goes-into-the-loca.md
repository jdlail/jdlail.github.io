Does Google need [a hyperlocal news play](https://valleywag.gawker.com/5154633/at-last-google-funds-a-bailout-for-reporters) to crack the local advertising market? Or has Google's Tim Anderson just recognized [a bunch of smart people](https://www.patch.com/about)?  
  
You got to like his stated motivations:  
  
> Tim believes that Patch should be in every community in America, and wants Patch in his town. He wants to read local news stories done by journalists, make sure that local government is transparent and accountable, see all the ways he can give back to his community, and have his town be as interesting and alive online as it is offline.

I say best of luck to Patch. With Phillip Meyer and Jeff Jarvis as senior advisors, they've got quite a brain trust.
