[![You Can Message](/images/20071014_161939-thumb-450x425.webp)](/images/20071014_161939.webp)Someone drew these chalk messages on the Lakeshore Greenway trail in Knoxville for an organized walk or fun run. I like seeing them while I'm jogging. A couple more are at [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/tags/positive/). It's going to rain this week so they'll be gone soon.
