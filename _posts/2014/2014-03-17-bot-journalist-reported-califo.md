> [Ken Schwencke](https://schwanksta.com/), a journalist and programmer for the _Los Angeles Times_ , was jolted awake at 6:25 a.m. on Monday by an earthquake. He rolled out of bed and went straight to his computer, where he found a brief story about the quake already written and waiting in the system. He glanced over the text and hit "publish." And that's how the _LAT_ became the first media outlet to report on this morning's temblor. "I think we had it up within three minutes," Schwencke told me.

The story was "written" by a program called Quakebot which Schwencke created some three years ago. [Here's the Bot story](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/earthquake-27-quake-strikes-near-westwood-california-rdivor,0,3229825.story#ixzz2wEWmfUmX). While not award-winning journalism, it got the news out.
