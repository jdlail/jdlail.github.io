[![Alison Stewart](/031212_stewart_vsm_7a.vlarge-thumb.jpeg)](/031212_stewart_vsm_7a.vlarge.jpeg)Yeah, I'm an Alison Stewart fan. I'm glad to see she's got her own afternoon show on MSNNBC, "[The Most](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12537219/)," which debuted May. 1. I'm Tivoing it for awhile to see if it lives up to the hype. It sounds like a good vehicle for Stewart. Wish it didn't air at 3 p.m.  I started watching [Stewart](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3080452/) when she was the "news girl" on ABC's "World New Now." I'm not an insomniac; I just get up early. Stewart was pretty much the only reason to watch World News Now. Her last day on WNN was Jan. 8, 2002, after about a two-year stint. (I'm now hooked on Bloomberg in the early AM these days, but it's definitely not as quirky as Stewart's WNN days.) I never watched her on MTV, but the Brown University grad won a Peabody for her political coverage in the 1990s. And I had no idea she worked on CBS's "Sunday Morning" and "48 Hours." It's nice to see someone who doesn't fit the female TV personality stereotype be very successful in the biz. Good luck and it looks like you're having a good year to turn 40 this summer.
