Wikipedia implemented Monday a registration system for new posts after getting its facts wrong in a bio on Tennessean John Seigenthaler. See [story](https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TN_WIKIPEDIA_RULES_TNOL-?SITE=TNKNN&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).  Wikipedia's "Seigenthaler saga" raises anew credibility concerns about collaborative writing and peer collaboration. I suppose to some Wikipedia proponents, it proves how self-correcting the process can be. To others, it means the site is wrong until proven right. Seigenthaler, for example, was complaining in the Monday AP story that a corrected version of his bio still got it wrong.. See the Wikipedia entry [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Seigenthaler_Sr.).

> "The marketplace of ideas ultimately will take care of the problem," Seigenthaler said. "In the meantime, what happens to people like me?"

That's a good question.
