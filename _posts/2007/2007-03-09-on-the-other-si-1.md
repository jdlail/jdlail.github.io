[Seth Gitner](https://www.collegemediainnovation.org/blog/2007/03/09/gitner-on-roanokes-help-wanted-ad/) of Roanoke talks about the "[editor ad](https://www.roanoke.com/editorjob/interactive.html)." Pay attention to his commitment to trying and failing. "Those failings will take you to your successes." The clip isn't really about the process of innovating, it's about how the project was designed to be viral, but it's a great thought to keep in mind. From Bryan Murley, who was trying some new things himself. Tags: [roanoke.com](https://technorati.com/tag/roanoke.com) | [innovation](https://technorati.com/tag/innovation)
