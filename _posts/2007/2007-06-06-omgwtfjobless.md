![Brittney Gilbert](/images/2005030500134788_avatar_brittneygilbert.webp)Brittney Gilbert, a really distinctive voice and blogging pioneer at a MSM TV station, resigned her job. Here's her resignation post on [Nashville is Talking](https://www.nashvilleistalking.com/2007/06/06/i-guess-this-is-goodbye/) and a post on her [personal site](https://brittney.typepad.com/sparkwood_21/2007/06/omgwtfjobless.html). Apparently, a blog slug fest over a link she did was the last hit she wanted to take.

> Perhaps by being the beneficiary of a full-time blogging gig that a lot of people would love to have it means that I am a “pseudo-quasi-celebrity” who has to take the insults and criticisms and constant job threatening with the territory. But, I’m not cut out for it. I thought I was, but I’m not.

> ... This is the internet. People are vicious. They are even more vicious when they fail to make any distinction between you and a feelingless, faceless media company.

I don't know Brittney. I've never met her, but I have read har. She did a great job for WKRN. I can, however, fully understand. People at the other end of the keyboard sometimes do forget they're talking to people. Things are said that would never be said face-to-face. I, like, her, wish there were a few things I hadn't clicked the "save" or "send" button to. And, yes, she's right when she says being criticized seemed to be OK when she came to be a face of a media company. It just comes with the territory. I wish her luck. From the supportive comments on both sites above, she obviously made many, many great friends. (With apologies for stealing your blog post title. It was too good.).
