The Andrew Meyer episode at the University of Florida has the social news phenomenon down to a checklist. It's worth studying.

The social news formula (in no particular order):

  1. Post a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqAVvlyVbag) on Youtube. _Chris Albrecht on_[_NewTeeVee_](https://newteevee.com/2007/09/18/taser-incident-sparks-uproar/) _: Of course it’s there. What else would you do with it? Put it in a manila envelope and send it to your local paper? This isn’t the fifties. Or even the nineties._
  2. [Raise awareness](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=5779218759) on Facebook.
  3. Do a [Web site](https://www.theandrewmeyer.com/).
  4. [Mainstream media coverage](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/sep/19/florida-student-arrested-tasered-kerry-forum-has-p/)
  5. Blogger buzz [happens](https://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=%22andrew+meyer%22&btnG=Search+Blogs).

Get used to covering news that happens this way.
