President Bush apparently believes bloggers are journalists.  
  
In the closing days of 2007, Bush signed the OPEN Government Act, which strengthens the Freedom of Information Act and also importantly extends journalist status in many cases to bloggers and other independent writers. This makes them eligible for reduced fees when getting FOIA information out of the government.  
  
[Doc Searls](https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/01/03/bush-for-bloggers-if-not-vice-versa/) did something on it and the Society of Professional Journalists put out a [press release](https://www.spj.org/news.asp?REF=755#755). 
  
Now about that starving part.
