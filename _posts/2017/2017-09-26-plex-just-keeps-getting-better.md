I've been using [Plex](https://plex.tv) for several months now and [it just got news](https://www.plex.tv/blog/all-the-news-thats-fit-to-plex/). Coupled with the [iOS app](https://www.plex.tv/apps/mobile/ios/), I use it as a personal Spotify. I find it less compelling for streaming video, but I don't own a lot of video to stream. It does photos, but there may be better alternatives. it is a great way to organize all media. I don't think it's a Netflix or Amazon Video competitor, but the addition of news services does make it even more useful. I use it on a QNAP NAS, but there are number of ways to host your own Plex server, including a cloud option. Check it out.
