> I can't imagine the folks in Appalachia grooving to iWilli's "Yes We Can" video. They are probably watching re-runs of "I Love Lucy" on TV sets with rabbit-ear antennae and listening to "The Grand Ole Opry" on Saturday nights on WSM-AM radio - the king of Appalachia media.  
>
> And they more than likely won't watch Obama's inauguration speech, which is sure to be a humdinger. But I can imagine that the majority of Obama's ardent young, post-racial, post-Appalachia supporters watching their president's inauguration address on their computers - the media of choice of a new, young, educated generation -- not the media of choice in Appalachia.
