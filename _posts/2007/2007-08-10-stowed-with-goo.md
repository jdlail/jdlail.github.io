Folks may not pay for content online, but I'm betting they'll pay to keep their content online ... and so is Google. From the [Google blog](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/simple-way-to-get-more-storage.html)

> When you reach the limit of free storage (i.e., 1GB for Picasa Web Albums, 2.8GB for Gmail), consider this your overflow solution. Plans start at $20/year for 6GB (yes, $5 cheaper than before), with larger plans ranging up to 250GB.

Sounds like a pretty fair deal. Tags: [web apps](https://technorati.com/tag/web apps) | [online storage](https://technorati.com/tag/online storage)
