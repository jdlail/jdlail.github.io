An inky-fingered print journalist to multimedia contender weighs in. Just discovered a new blog from Ian Reeves called [Streaming Blue Murder](https://www.ianreevesmedia.co.uk/blog.html), subtitled "Old journalism dog. New video tricks." Looks it's going to ba a good one! But does "streaming blue murder" mean something? if it does, it flew right over me.
