Mike Cassidy on [Media Post's Video Insider blog](https://blogs.mediapost.com/video_insider/?p=102) on newspaper video: 

> Many newspapers can, and I believe will, become more dominant again -- but not in their current form. In the long term, the newspaper itself may be the least popular source of information and will remain a newspaper in name only. These publications will ultimately succeed by redefining themselves as content distributors through all sorts of channels with no limitations. Online video is the first step toward achieving this goal, and is the driving factor in how these storied companies will once again reclaim some of their allure.

He says _every story_ needs to be done as video to compete compete with broadcasters online and to try to capture the young audience.

If true, we have a ways to go. TV doesn't do every Web story as video.
