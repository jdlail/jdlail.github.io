![ONA](/images/onalogo.webp)I was watching the [Livestream.com](https://www.livestream.com/) Web live video of the [Online Journalism Awards](https://conference.journalists.org/2009conference/2009/10/04/publish2-my-ballard-and-gotham-gazette-win-inaugural-ojas/) presentation while I was updating knoxnews/govolsxtra Saturday night.
