Barry "[Inn of the Last Home](https://lasthome.blogspot.com/)" Wallace emails that his college roommate Gary and his brother, Phillip, have put together a website about amusement parks: [RexandTheBeast.com](https://www.rexandthebeast.com/).   They will be doing reviews and reports of new rides.

And then [there's a movie](https://www.rexandthebeast.com/node/152).

Enjoy the ride!

They ought to get hooked up with my old Scripps colleague Robert Niles and his "[Theme Park Insider](https://www.themeparkinsider.com/)."
