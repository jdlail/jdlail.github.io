Sorry, [Mashable](https://mashable.com/2011/12/28/digital-journalism-2011/):  
  
> This wasn't the year that paywalls paid off: It was the year that some paywalls paid off for some specific outlets while the rest struggled. That's not such a catchy headline. But then again, we all know that sometimes reality doesn't match the simplicity of the news.
