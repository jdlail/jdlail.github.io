Career columnist Penelope Trunk [blogs her firing](https://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2007/12/27/how-to-deal-with-getting-fired-from-yahoo/) from Yahoo!.  
  
There's a tremendous outpouring in the comments as well as some catty ones there and on [Valleywag](https://valleywag.com/338109/yahoo-cans-female-finance-columnist-tells-her-to-try-lifestyles)..  
  
She says she was fired because her column commanded low advertising rates. So reporters and writers out there: How's your CPM doing?  
  
Print media writers look askance at how ratings affect TV news, but in the [digital economy](https://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050412glaser/), they face the prospect of eventually being tied to their advertising generating power, the almighty CPM,  or _advertising cost per thousand impressions_.  
  
I've done some rough calculating on my newspaper's [Web site](https://www.knoxnews.com/) and I don't see any writers generating their salary in ad revenues from online. I think [others](https://www.howardowens.com/2007/tolles-sees-a-journalism-future-of-more-work-less-pay/) are making similar calculations. On the other side, the same forces are seeing sports cherry-picked from newspapers for [six figure salaries by ESPN](https://www.lucasgrindley.com/2007/12/as_the_sports_writers_leave_so_too_might.html).  
  
Penelope Trunk; she'll do fine. For hundreds of other journalists, the value placed on their work will be a bleak reality.  
  
(One of my favorite blog posts by her is about the [origin of her name](https://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2007/03/05/my-name-is-not-really-penelope/), a "brand me" classic. Her Wikipedia [entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope_Trunk), however, is over the top caustic, describing her as an "American idiot," at least at the time of this writing.)
