Jeff Cole, director of USC's Center for the Digital Future:  
  
> In 1975, the average American spent 16 hours a week in front of a screen. Last year, that figure hit 34 hours and should grow to 50 hours in a few years. _Much of that growth will come from mobile video_ , as consumers watch more TV and more video on mobile screens in general.

Emphasis added on the part of about "mobile video," which is another reason, you should be at "[Smart Phones for Smart Journalists](https://journalists.org/events/event_details.asp?id=96897)" in Nashville on April 9.
