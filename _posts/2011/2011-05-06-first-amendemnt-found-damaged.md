From the [Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2011/may/05/officials-vs-free-press/):  
  
> Last Thursday, one of our reporters, Kate Harrison, was following volunteers cleaning up debris in the heavily damaged Apison area when she was confronted by three veteran, high-ranking public officials who ordered her to stop taking photographs. The officials -- Hamilton County Sheriff Jim Hammond, Chattanooga Police Chief Bobby Dodd and Hamilton County's director of emergency services, Don Allen -- clearly should have known that Harrison's work was constitutionally protected. That they could occupy such high positions and not know, or care about, or respect the nation's First Amendment rights boggles the mind.

You'd like to this was an anonmaly, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn it's not. The Chattanooga paper's incidents involve law enforcement and public officials in two states.
