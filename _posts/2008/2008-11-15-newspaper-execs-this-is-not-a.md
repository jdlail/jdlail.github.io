Industry execs convene to discuss [crisis](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/pages/resources/2008/11/ceo_summit_on_saving_an_indust/).  
  
Some suggestions offered to the [attendees](https://www.fitzandjen.com/2008/11/list-of-api-cri.html):  
  
> * Act like an entrepreneur; stop thinking first about why a new approach won't work.
> * Create a portfolio of initiatives; recognize that some will fail and kill those quickly.
> * Don't wait for every data point before taking action. "Ready, fire, aim" should be the operating principle, Shein said.
> * Use downsizing as a tool when necessary to achieve a larger strategy, not simply as a cost-cutting goal.
> * Figure out how to leverage core competencies into new directions and new niches.
> * Be honest with employees, and get ideas from those on the front lines.
> * Don't sit and cower and weep about your problems. Inspire.
> * Collaborate with outside entities that can bring expertise or resources.
> * Pay attention to, and leverage, the brand.
>

These would have had a lot more impact five years ago.
