[![Rob Curley](/images/robcurleycalif-thumb-150x116.webp)](/images/robcurleycalif.webp)Yes, it was that big. No other venue could contain him. It had to be moved from Thompson-Boling Arena.

Washington Post VP for product development [Rob Curley](https://www.robcurley.com/), who is to online newspaper journalism what [Timothy Leary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_leary) was to psychedelics, brought his irreverent, inspiring story to a not-quite-full Neyland Stadium on the University of Tennessee campus last night.

The crowd of journalism students and educators, news professionals and local bloggers got treated to a Red Bull-powered presentation that spanned years of his groundbreaking work at Web sites in Kansas (he's an unabashed Jayhawks fan), Florida and Washington.

Here's some great coverage from [Katie Allison Granju](https://knoxvilletalks.com/2008/04/04/luxe-and-learn-at-ut/), [Randy Neal](https://www.knoxviews.com/node/7482), [Bob Benz](https://www.maroonventures.com/blog/?p=14) and [Russ McBee](https://russmcbee.com/archive/2008/04/04/some-thoughts-on-rob-curley-s-presentation.aspx). The speech was part of a great program put together by UT's [Jim Stovall.](https://jprof.blogspot.com/)

Do you really think he could pass for [Barry Manilow](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chadjackson/138471965/) with fluffed up hair?
