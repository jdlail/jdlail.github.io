Howard Owens is on target in a post on "[Video killed the television star](https://www.howardowens.com/2006/video-killed-the-television-star/)" on video strategies for online newspapers. If innovation and disruption come from small startups (or startup-like operations) who come out of nowhere with a product that is good enough to meet a need, then operate like they do. Two guys in a garage or dorm room didn't create a behemoth Internet portal with mail, maps, movies and more; they created a collection of links. It grew into a behemoth. Craig Newmark started with an email to friends and grew it into Craigslist. Start with what you can do and make it better. Just do.
