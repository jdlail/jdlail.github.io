Kiyoshi Martinez has created a [new entrant](https://kiyoshimartinez.com/nerdlusus/2008/07/23/introducing-journalismme/) in journalism blog aggregators, [Journalism.me](https://journalism.me/), _the journalism blogosphere_. The site is an aggregation of journalists who blog mostly about journalism from their personal sites.  
  
> I set out to create a definitive -- but ever expanding! -- list of young journalism bloggers and just provide it as a simple resource. But then I got to thinking that maybe I could do more than just a list.  
>
> So, I bought the domain name "journalism.me" and went to work building a list of not just young journalism bloggers, but a more general list of personal blogs by journalists who blog about journalism. Yes, I'm aware of how meta this is.

> ...

> So, what you end up with is a collection of individual voices discussing journalism all focused in one place. Hopefully, the site will drive traffic to their blogs and connect them with each other.

Since February, [Martinze](https://kiyoshimartinez.com/nerdlusus/about/) has been a communications and public affairs specialist for the Illinois Senate Republican Caucus.  
  
Good luck with your project!
