One thing I like about [Mashable](https://www.mashable.com/) (despite [Louis Gray's](https://www.louisgray.com/live/2008/01/mashable-uses-list-power-to-steal-b.html) problems with it) are the list posts of resources, you know 10,000 PhotoShop links or Endless Firefox add-ons.  They're great.  
  
But now comes Journerdism with a [multimedia McGuyver toolset](https://www.journerdism.com/index.php/2008/01/21/be-a-multimedia-mcguyver-101-diy-tools-and-techniques-for-cool-professional-photo-audio-and-video-gear-on-the-cheap/). A treat!
