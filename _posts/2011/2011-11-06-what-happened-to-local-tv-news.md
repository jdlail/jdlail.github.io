Running on Empty: The Brain Drain in Local TV News (TRT 57:00). This documentary was produced by Bill and Karin Schwanbeck, professors of journalism at Quinnipiac University.   
  
The documentary covers a development that doesn't bode well for local communities. While this trend may be accentuated in TV newsrooms, similar pressures exist in newspaper newsrooms.  
  
There are reporters, editors and even publishers/general managers and, yes, corporate executives trying to serve their local communities well with impactful journalism, but with less and with difficult business realities even in the best of circumstances.
