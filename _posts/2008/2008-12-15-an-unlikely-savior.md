Illinois Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich [saves newspapers](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/business/media/15carr.html)?

> The public is not going look at the Blaggy scandal and slap itself on the forehead in recognition of the threat posed to democracy by shrinking newsrooms. The public is learning everything it cares to know about Blaggy from TV and blogs. Newspapers? You mean those things to which the blogs hyperlink out? Face it, we are losing a generation of readers, and if you doubt how serious that may be, ask a Gen-Xer when they last went to a horse track -- now there's a dying industry that's now lost a couple generations.
