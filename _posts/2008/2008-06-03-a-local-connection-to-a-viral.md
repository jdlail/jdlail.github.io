[Susan Mernit](https://www.susanmernit.com/blog/2008/05/pork-beans-is-one-juicy-mess.html) said "Did I mention how much I enjoy Weezers Pork and Beans video?  The meta-approach of making a video that includes bits of popular vids from YouTube--notably Tay Zonday of Chocolate Rain Blendtec's "Will it Blend" blender, Miss Teen South Carolina, the  Numa Numa video, All Your Base are Belong to Us, Peanut Butter Jelly Time, the "stupid" ninja guy, and a nerd who made  the Guinness Book of World Records for wearing the most t-shirts at any time. just makes me smile."

Relative newcomers to Knoxville may not know this: Weezer guitarist Brian Bell is an Knoxville expatriate living in L.A. and a Bearden High School. He is the son of a university geography professor and an elementary school principal.  
  
From his 1994 bio on the [Weezer](https://www.weezer.com/info/bios/index.html) site:  
  
> "raised in tennessee, little brian knew he wanted to be a rock star at an early age. lucky enough to catch and elvis (presley, that is) concert at the age of four, he wanted nothing else but to be a hounddog. studying "geetar" pickin' on tv from such fine eastern tennessee programs as "the barneyloo and buster show" and, of course, "hee haw," little brian learned how to pick 'n' grin on a ukelele his grandma won at a bingo game. brian's dad, a wacky absent-minded professor and ex-college dj, turned him onto cool music he had from the 50's and 60's. so, armed with his first turntable, a fisher price lo-fi stereo system, little brian managed to scratch and destroy most of dad's valuable 45's. as brian grew older, he began to feel isolated and out-of-place with the other reindeer. while the "normal" tennessee boys were out hunting possum, chewing tobacco and making up fish stories, he preferred to stay home and watch billy mumy movies. ah, movies, music and show biz. Why was it all based in one glorious place -- los angeles? so, just like the clampetts, brian packed up my bags and moved to yucca St., hollywired (cause everyone he met at first was on crystal meth.) not at all like the movies."
