[![TN Transparency 2.0](/assets_c/2011/03/tennessee-opentransparency2-thumb-485x374-636.webp)](/images/tennessee-opentransparency2.webp)  
In the [second annual ranking](https://www.uspirg.org/home/reports/report-archives/tax--budget-policy/tax--budget-policy--reports/following-the-money-2011) of states' progress toward new standards of "comprehensive, one-stop, one-click budget accountability and accessibility," Tennesse gets a "D-."  
  
The ranking of how states are achieving [Transparency 2.0](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2009/04/15/transparency-20/) standards was done by [U.S. PIRG](https://www.uspirg.org/), the federation of state Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs)  
  
An interactive map on the federation's website lets you [drill down into the data](https://www.uspirg.org/home/reports/report-archives/tax--budget-policy/tax--budget-policy--reports/following-the-money-2011) for each state.  
  
Tennessee, for example, gets the maximum positive score for having a ["checkbook-level" website](https://tn.gov/opengov/), but its low grades come from the site not offering much information.  
  
Seems to be story of open government in Tennessee.
