[![Outer Banks](/images/847723116_e96ec24e61-thumb-150x221.webp)](/images/847723116_e96ec24e61.webp)One of the best [Best Scenic Drives in the U.S.](https://travel.yahoo.com/p-interests-22859295) is close by:  
  
> **Blue Ridge Parkway**  
>
> Stretching some 469 miles along the Southern Appalachian Mountains and linking two eastern national parks -- Virginia's Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and North Carolina's Great Smoky Mountains -- the Blue Ridge Parkway has often been referred to as "America's Favorite Drive." It's certainly the country's first rural parkway -- parts of it date back to 1930s (when construction began as a make-work project during the Depression) -- and the longest, with breathtaking scenery and dozens of recreational opportunities to distract you when you need to stretch your legs.  
>
> Though some may argue that autumn is the best season to drive this stretch, as the brilliant fall foliage is in full effect, May is also a superb time to head this way, to witness the profusion of wildflowers in bloom along the elevated mountainsides. Also included in this scenic route is the impressive Skyline Drive, a 105-mile swath of road that cuts through Shenandoah National Park. Of course, no nature drive of this sort would be quite complete without wildlife sightings: Keep an eye out for resident whitetail deer and black bears.

Not on the list, but which should be up for consideration is [NC 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Highway_12) which goes from Corolla to Cedar Island on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
