We had some [moving photos](https://www.knoxnews.com/photos/galleries/2008/jul/22/images-cpl-jason-hovaters-funeral/) on knoxnews earlier this week from a military funeral, but covering a military funeral has become something of a controversy.  
  
Photo intern Kohl Threlkeld [writes about his experience](https://www.sportsshooter.com/message_display.html?tid=30125) while the Patriot Guard Riders and others respond on News Sentinel Editor [Jack McElroy's blog](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/editor/2008/07/patriot_guard_obstructs_funera.shtml).  
  
You can find more about the Patriot Guard Riders on the organization's [Web site](https://www.patriotguard.org/).
