Noticed Eleanor Cippel, Knoxville-based director of innovation for E.W. Scripps, got some pub in an [AP story](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/apr/15/papers-tailor-online-content-increase-audience-ad-/) today at the Newspaper Association of America's trade show in Washington.  
  
> Eleanor Cippel, director of innovation for Cincinnati-based E.W. Scripps, said her company started a $1.5 million "entrepreneurial fund," similar to a venture capital fund, more than a year ago to bankroll business ideas mainly from their employees.  
>
> In that time, the company has reviewed about 175 ideas and funded about 15 mostly Web-related products, she said. Examples are [RedBlueAmerica.com](https://www.redblueamerica.com/), which caters to readers who want to know about opinions from different sides of an issue, and [RootClip](https://www.rootclip.com/), another Web site that invites users to submit short videos.  
>
> The idea, she said, is to grow loyalty within such audiences.

[KnoxMoms](https://www.knoxmoms.com/) is another creation of the fund. [RootClip](https://www.rootclip.com/), have you seen that one.? Still figuring it out? I like to think of it as "Lost" on a park bench, but that's just me.
