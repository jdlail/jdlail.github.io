Attention Internet sellers. [Bryon Chesney](https://knoxtrivia.blogspot.com/2007/07/knoxville-tied-for-second-most-ebay.html) noticed the venerable Scarborough Research says Knoxville, Tenn. is tied for No. 2 in the penetration of eBay among Internet users. It's an [interesting list](https://www.scarborough.com/press_releases/eBay%20Final%20731%2007.pdf). Some factoids from the release:

* eBay Visitors are 37 percent more likely than the average Internet user to have spent $2,500 or more online during the past year.
* They are 16 percent more likely to be ages of 18-24, and 12 percent more likely to be male.
* They are 71 percent more likely to buy consumer electronics online, and account for 53 percent of all online purchasers in this category.
