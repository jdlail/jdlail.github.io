Red Light cameras from a company called Redflex Traffic Systems Inc. are a [hot topic](https://www.knoxnews.com/search/?q=redflex&sortby=date&sources=site&all=on) in Knoxville, even a [hot target](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/apr/26/alleged-camera-shooter-arrested/).  
  
But in St. Louis, Alderman Freeman Bosley recently said about camera tickets: "If you threw it in the trash, nothing would happen."  
  
Huh? What about here?  
  
Kurt Greenbaum of the STLtoday.com says the cameras are [popular fodder](https://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/virtual-st-louis/general/2008/04/red-light-cameras-are-popular-fodder-for-st-louis-bloggers/#comment-153) for bloggers there. So too [here](https://blognetwork.knoxnews.com/search.php?rss_query=redflex&image.x=19&image.y=14).  
  
(Fine print disclaimer: Don't blame me if you throw them away.)
