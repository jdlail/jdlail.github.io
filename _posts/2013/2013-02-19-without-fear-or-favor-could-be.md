Some 117 years ago, [Adolph Ochs](https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1014), who began his career in Knoxville before buying a newspaper in Chattanooga, [published a set of principles](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/19/opinion/without-fear-or-favor.html) for his newest newspaper in which he said it would "to give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved."  
  
Ochs, but 38 at the time, wrote that in _The New York Times_. It was a winning business model. "Without fear or favor" became a [journalism credo](https://www.poynter.org/uncategorized/22557/values-moment-leading-without-fear-or-favor/) that served journalism and the business of media well for over 100 years.  
  
But former Newsweek editor, Pulitzer Prize winner and historian [Jon Meacham](https://www.jonmeacham.com/about/) said the course Ochs set may turn out to be a brief exception for journalism. The media of the 1700s and 1800s was highly partisan and the media seems to be returning to those roots today. That is where revenue is flowing, Meacham said, and you go hunting "where the ducks are."

Mecham's comment was in response to a question about editor [Francis Preston Blair](https://www.blairhouse.org/h_blairs.html) following a speech he gave on President's Day at a [packed Bijou Theatre in Knoxville](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2013/feb/18/presidential-historian-marks-presidents-day-with/).  
  
He didn't mention them by name, but probably the biggest example of this trend are the news networks: Fox, [MSNBC](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/business/media/msnbc-its-ratings-rising-gains-ground-on-fox-news.html) and CNN. CNN, which doesn't align itself with either conservative or liberal political point of view, [trails in the ratings](https://www.deadline.com/2012/12/fox-news-2012-cable-news-networks-tv-ratings-msnbc-cnn/) to the other two, which have adopted strategies with strong political points of view.  
  
Some suggest [transparency is the new objectivit](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/public-editor/when-reporters-get-personal.html)y. Where do you see the ducks?
