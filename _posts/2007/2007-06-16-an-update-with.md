Between vacation and some work projects, I've slowed down, but I'm continuing. This is for last week (week ending June 10). Did some jogging on a wonderful bike trail in Westerville, Ohio. And I also noticed the [L.A. Time history of fatblogging](https://www.latimes.com/technology/la-fi-fatblog15jun15,1,141510.story?ctrack=1&cset=true).
