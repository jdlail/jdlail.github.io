Very addictive trivia site. It asks true false question and keeps a running score. You can save your score, but there's no registration. Besides the actual travia quiz, the site is very aggressive around developing virla links. Good idea. Try it yourself. There's probably a news application here ... hmmm. _Smart, very smart._
