> Readers feared that all the copy editors had been laid off, or even "massacred," as one put it.

That's a paragraph from Deirdre Edgar's explanation of the problem in the Los Angeles Times' Readers' Representative Journal blog,  
  
Instead of a massacre, it turns out the newsroom had never seen the page due to a "technical error" in the pressroom. But does this mean the Los Angeles Times does not have copy editors who actually proof a physical copy of the printed edition, at least giving it a once over?
