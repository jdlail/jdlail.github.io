> Sometimes I say it’s good to be a dumb blond.

[\-- Sharelle Klaus of Dry Soda in an interview with Gregory Galant.](https://www.venturevoice.com/2006/06/vv_show_35_sharelle_klaus_of_d.html#more) Klaus was talking about how not knowing the rules allowed her to successfully break a lot of rules in launching her luxury soda company [Dry Soda](https://www.drysoda.com/) that has flavors kumquat, lemon grass, lavender, and rhubarb. In less than a year, she's creating a splash in a essentially a new food and beverage category: premium sodas. Definitely, not a dumb blond.
