I have a [Polar F6 Heart Rate Monitor Watch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007VB4JI?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007VB4JI)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0007VB4JI). Works great, except for one thing: the Sonic Link feature, that communications with your computer's microphone and sends data to the [Polar Fitness Trainer](https://www.polarfitnesstrainer.com) Web site. It usually takes me several times for the computer to hear the watch/heart monitor's chirping. Sometimes I find it easier to just manually enter the data, but then the next time it does connect, the data is duped. Anyone else have this problem? Suggestions? Leave a comment. An aside. I also think it's weird that the site that stores the data has no import or export feature. What's up with that? I'm obivously not a fitness nut, but I'm geeky enough to like to track stuff like exercise duration and intensity as measured by heart rate with the aid of a tool. It doesn't do much for procrastination, I've found. Been listening to Ben Harper's album "[Both Sides of the Gun](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGEKWE?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000EGEKWE)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000EGEKWE)" _... I believe in a better way ..._
