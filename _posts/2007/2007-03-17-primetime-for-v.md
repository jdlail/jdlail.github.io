The always interesting [Mark "Blog Maverick" Cuban](https://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/03/16/when-do-people-watch-online-video/) tells us when people watch video online (based on Comscore data):

> When do more people watch online video than any other time ? From 10am to 5pm, mon to fri. Thats when 30pct of all online video viewing takes place. If you want to go a little earlier, for those that get to work early, add another 7pct. So that 37pct of all online viewing activity takes place from 7am to 5pm. Or put another way, about 50pct of all video viewing during weekdays happens from 7am to 5pm. Thats a big number.

He says it hasn't changed all that much from his old days in audio. And while he doesn't note it, the percentages certainly roughly match the times of day for heavy use of news sites in general. At KnoxNews, we see the upward spike starting at 8 a.m. We have a lot of people in this market who get to work at 7 or 7:30. This certainly means watching video at the workplace is tolerated by managers and IT folks, although I'm sure there is some hand wringing. What's the proper response when the boss walks up behind you when you're watching the latest crazy clip from YouTube? ... Yeah, you need a bigger boss mirror. For news sites, the numbers mean breaking video news could be as important as breaking text news.
