Linking illegal (via [Lost Remote](https://www.lostremote.com/2006/12/10/fox-threatens-site-for-linking-to-copyrighted-video/))? If the link is to material that violates someone else's copyright, it [seems](https://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/01/fox_commits_copyrigh.html) you're in a gray area.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Fred von Lohmann notes there is a great incentive for sites to remove the links instead of trying to fight the battle. These leaves a lot of room for lawyers in a Web 2.0 world where content (or data) is coming from many sources.
