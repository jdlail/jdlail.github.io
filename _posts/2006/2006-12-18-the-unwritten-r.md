I noticed a few "unwritten rules" posts today and decided to have some fun with it. Actually what got me going was this post ValleyWag on the [unpublished rental rates](https://www.valleywag.com/tech/silicon-valley-users-guide/svug-8-whats-the-protocol-at-wifi-cafes-221732.php) of Wi-Fi in cafes. Interesting new social problem and it could have been the "unwritten rules of Wi-Fi in cafes." Unwritten rules can be well, enigmatic. I did run across all the unwritten rules below. What's you favorite or craziest unwritten rule (or is it against the rules to ask)?
