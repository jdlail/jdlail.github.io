![This is Jack Lail?](/images/mocktech012507.webp) At some point in time, I became a [MockTech Celeb](https://www.mocktech.com/geek/article.php?story=20070120205242926), just a hair less prestigious as being on the [Forbes Web Celeb 25](https://www.forbes.com/2007/01/23/internet-fame-celebrity-tech-media-cx_de_06webceleb_0123land.html) which Knoxville's [Glenn Reynolds](https://www.instapundit.com/) made at No. 7 this week. I have my own [paparazzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi) email address [spottedjackL@gmail.com](mailto:spottedjackL@gmail.com). Well, not mine, but anyway. So help the MockTech keep track of me -- if you can! As you can see from the photo at right, I am elusive.
