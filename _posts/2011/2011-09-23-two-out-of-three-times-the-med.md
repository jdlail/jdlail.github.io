When people say there's nothing but "bad news," they may mean wrong or slanted.  
  
> ![9-22-11-2.png](/images/9-22-11-2.webp)The widely-shared belief that news stories are inaccurate cuts to the press's core mission: Just 25% say that in general news organizations get the facts straight while 66% say stories are often inaccurate. As recently as four years ago, 39% said news organizations mostly get the facts straight and 53% said stories are often inaccurate.

> But Americans have a very different view of the news sources they rely on than they do of the news media generally. When asked to rate the accuracy of stories from the sources where they get most of their news, the percentage saying  these outlets get the facts straight more than doubles. Fully 62% say their main news sources get the facts straight, while just 30% say stories are often inaccurate.
