[![Virgil Griffith](/assets_c/2008/07/VirgilGriffith-thumb-150x225.webp)](/images/VirgilGriffith.webp)Some are calling what [Virgil Griffith](https://virgil.gr/) is doing hacking, but I think it's journalism, computational journalism.  
  
Griffith, a graduate student in Computation and Neural Systems at Caltech, [created a stir](https://www.forbes.com/technology/2008/07/19/security-hackers-internet-tech-cx_ag_0719wikiwatcher.html) last year when he released [Wikiscanner](https://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/classic.php). It revealed how active companies were in cleansing their Wikipedia entries of negative news. Now, Griffith, pictured on right, has released [Wikiwatcher](https://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/), a set of tools that go further in revealing just who makes edits to Wikipedia entries.  
  
The software is part of a Cal Tech project called "[Wikiganda](https://announcements.surf.caltech.edu/index.cfm?event=ViewAODetail&id=209&inFrame=1&type=)" that says:  
  
> Deliberate misinformation and false propaganda has been a problem since the dawn of civilization. This problem is acute with ever more information obtained --- by all segments of the public --- from open digital encyclopaedias such as Wikipedia. Deliberate insertions of falsehoods, or partial truths, are especially dangerous in an election year. The goal of this project is to develop and implement algorithms that help identify information that may be suspect.

Some people are voicing privacy concerns, but there's usually some yelps when a toe or two get stubbed when someone start turning over rocks. I hope Griffith and the other members on his team keep turning over rocks.
