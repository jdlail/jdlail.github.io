Musings on online newspapers from 1978. Yes, 1978. [Kenneth Edwards](https://paleo-future.blogspot.com/2007/08/electronic-newspaper-1978.html) got it amazingly right. It's held up better with time than, say, disco music. 

> If we think of a newspaper as being a printed object delivered to our homes, we may be talking about replacing newspaper with an electronic signal. But if we think (as I do) of newspapers as organizations which disseminate news and information by the most efficient methods available - then we are thinking in terms of applying a new technology to an existing institution.

Even more amazing is nearly 30 years later, a lot of people who get paychecks from newspapers haven't gotten this one. Maybe, they're still listening to the Bee Gees?
