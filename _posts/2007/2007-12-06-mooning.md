[![Moon just before sunrise](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2308/2090427329_0d569c3265_t.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/2090427329/ "Moon just before sunrise by jacklail, on Flickr")My wife suggested this would make a neat photo and I agree. It's the moon and a star (i guess, as opposed to a planet) in the upper part of the frame. Can any of you astronomical types enlighten me? It was taken just before sunrise today.

Update: [Venus](https://stardate.org/nightsky/almanac/)? StarDate says for Dec. 6: _"Look below Venus at dawn for the crescent Moon, which is at apogee."_
