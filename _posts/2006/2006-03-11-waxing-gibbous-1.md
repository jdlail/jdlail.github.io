[![Waxing Gibbous over Lenior City, March 11, 2006](/moonoverleniorcity-thumb.JPG)](/moonoverleniorcity.JPG)  
Saturday was a great day to be outside and I took this photo while at the baseball field at Lenoir City High School (see previous blog entry). It is, I learned, the moon in the Waxing Gibbous phase (an almost full phase). The full moon is about three days away. I used the "tint effect" in Picasa2 to emphasis it a bit in a way I like. It was a nice temperature for early in March to catch a baseball game. The temperature was about 75 when I got there and cooled down to maybe 70 when I left after the second game. Course the forecast says we're headed for rain and cold temperatures again by Tuesday.
