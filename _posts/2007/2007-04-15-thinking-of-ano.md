This is last week's update. I've done better this week. However, I did find this interesting. Since my shocking New Year's weigh-in (ah, the Christmas season does leave its little presents), I've lost 14.5 pounds. But from around this time a year ago, I'm down a mere 1.5 pounds. Does that mean the exercising is working or I just seasonally eat less? I probably did go on exercise jag last year, too. Who knows, off to the gym.     **Sessions****Calories burned** **Time exercising** **Miles jogged/eliptical**  **Actual** 2 1265 1:32 7.14  **Target** 4 2000 3:15 No advice   The month-to-date miles is 15.83 Tags: [jogging](https://technorati.com/tag/jogging) | [fatbloggers](https://technorati.com/tag/fatbloggers) | [jason calacanis](https://technorati.com/tag/jason calacanis)
