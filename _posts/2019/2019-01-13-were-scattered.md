![23andMe map visualization of where my DNA relatives using the 23andMe are located.](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/23andme-visualization.webp)

Cool map (or data visualization) from [23andMe](https://you.23andme.com) of where my relatives, who use the service and have shared their location, are located. Many of these are pretty distant, [third cousin](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-definition-of-a-third-cousin) or greater, but there is still a DNA connection.
