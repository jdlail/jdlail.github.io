An [interesting approach to managing comments](https://www.reporternews.com/news/2010/dec/11/a-plan-for-improving-online-conversation/?cid=Facebook) by editor Barton Cromeens at the Abilene Reporter-News: Get the commenting community involved and work hard at making comments add value:  
  
> The First Amendment is under attack.
>
> Ironically, the attacker is a free press that is frustrated with a changing media landscape and that is reacting poorly to a populace that is equally, if not more, frustrated by unmitigated, unrestrained vitriolic online commentary.
>
> Readers and communities are fed up. Demands and threats are being made.
>
> The most common demand - put an end to anonymous commentary. The most common threats - litigation, withdrawal of financial support, discontinuation of readership.
