Now, here's something to get viral over.  
  
> Voicemail is dead. Please tell everyone so they'll stop using it.

I've long had a message on my work desk phone voicemail that said the best way to reach me is by email. Alas, it does little to deter the truly persistent voicemail depositors.  
  
My problem with voicemail is that while it's easier for the messenger, it's just damn inefficient for the recipient.  
  
I've experimented with [Grand Central](https://www.grandcentral.com/), but not enough people use my GC number (865-686-6033) for that service to be of great value. I just haven't adopted it as my one "universal number."  
  
In the lesser of evils, I'd rather get an email than a voicemail
