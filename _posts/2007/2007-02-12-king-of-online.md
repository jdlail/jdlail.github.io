This is disruptive as hell...

> A new [Borrell Associates](https://www.borrellassociates.com/)’ report due to be released Tuesday finds that newspaper-run websites are making more money from VIDEO advertising than TV station sites are by a ratio of almost 3 to 1 ($81 million to $32 million).

See the post on [Terry Heaton's PoMo Blog](https://www.thepomoblog.com/archive/newspapers-make-more-from-online-video-than-tv/) I took a quick look at the report and in addition to what Terry Heaton notes, I noticed the Borrell report is projecting double-digit, triple-digit and gains over 1000 percent for local DMAs in 2007 from 2006. If 2006 was the year of YouTube, those outsized gains would certainly make 2007 the year of the video ad. The report says: "Remarkably, newspapers have made the transition to Web-based video advertising quicker than their local broadcast competitors have." A key has been "long-form" video in classified verticals, like our online advertising folks' Digital Edge Award finalist: [KnoxJobs.tv](https://www.knoxjobs.tv/) There's quite a bit of good, new information in the report.
