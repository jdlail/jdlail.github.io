Compete did an [analysis](https://blog.compete.com/2008/05/15/twitter-traffic-growth-usage-demographics/) of Twitter users in April. They found users tend to be Young, Male, and Twitter Addicted.  
  
Two fascinating stats:  
  
* Twitter skews heavily towards the college/twenty-something crowd. Twitter attracts 18-24 year-olds at nearly twice the rate of an average U.S website.
* Splitting age demographics based on usage intensity shows that heavy users tend to skew older than visitors who only hit the site once a month. This could indicate that while the younger segments are more exploratory, the 25-44 year old segments have found more value in Twitter and started to ramp up usage.
