There seem to a spate of articles about the future of news and newspaper -- most of them filled with dire predictions. One of the most thought-provoking I've seen appeared this week: Merrill Brown's "[Abandoning the News](https://www.carnegie.org/reporter/10/news/index.html)" report for the Carnegie Corp.

> Even if the daily newspaper industry's advertising revenue dwarfs its Internet business, the future of the American newspaper will be defined online from both a future readership point of view and perhaps in terms of future revenue streams as well. It is time for print industry investments in Internet products to match the online audience size and the extraordinary magnitude of the migration to digital news delivery.

My, my it's interesting time.
