Visit his [Web site](https://www.timobrien.net/index.cfm). He's got a body of work that's been consistently good since his Hot Rize days in the late '70s and early '80s at least.

If you've never heard him, here's a link to an [mp3](https://www.timobrien.net/livetracks/you_are_my_flower_2005-05-19.mp3) from his Web site, "You Are My Flower" recorded May 19, 2005 at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville.
