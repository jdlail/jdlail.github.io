I was more than halfway there, but well, anyway. Back boobs? Did you say "back boobs?" I don't read diet blogs, but this quote on [Susan Mernit's](https://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2007/07/noted_10.html) blog made me look: _You know you are getting fat when you discover that you have back boobs so big that they need their own bra._ That's from the blog "[Back in Skinny Jeans](https://www.backinskinnyjeans.com/2007/07/chats-in-my-hea.html)." Have mercy.
