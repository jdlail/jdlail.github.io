I had no idea what a [QR Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) was and now I [read](https://jp.blognation.com/2007/11/22/google-print-ads-include-japanese-qr-codes/) Google is putting them in newspaper print ads. The image at right is the QR code generated by [qrcode.kaywa.com](https://qrcode.kaywa.com/)for this Web site's URL.
