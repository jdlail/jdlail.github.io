[Ernie Pyle's Last Column](https://vimeo.com/76165237) from [James Brown](https://vimeo.com/user3047378) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). I had breakfast the other day in Indianapolis with my friend [James W. "Jim" Brown](https://brownimages.com/about/). He turned me on this video he did recently about the last column [Ernie Pyle](https://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/reference/notable-hoosiers/ernie-pyle#.UnP-JhDvLTo) wrote, a handwritten draft found in his pocket after he was killed, and about plans to print it as a small "book" on a letterpress. Among Jim Brown's many projects has been helping out [Pyle's hometown museum in Indiana](https://erniepyle.org).
