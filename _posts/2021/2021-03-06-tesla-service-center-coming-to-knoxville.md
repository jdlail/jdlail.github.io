With a Tesla Service Center r[umored to be opening in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/kw99f6/tesla_service_center_finally_coming_to_knoxville/) in the former Sears Automotive building at West town Mall (after being touted as "as opening next year" in by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in 2018), East Tennessee interest in the car company's models should increase.

(Tesla is [hiring for the Knoxville location](https://www.facebook.com/groups/524852597911854/permalink/1257550191308754), by the way.)

You already see a fair number of Teslas around town and there is an active [East Tennessee Tesla Owners](https://www.facebook.com/groups/524852597911854) group on Facebook. 2021 seems to the year of the electric vehicle push by other manufacturers as well.

If you are thinking of buying, feel free use my [Tesla referral code](https://ts.la/jack65708) for some free stuff/discounts.

Trivia: Since July I've spent an estimated .028 cents a mile for "fuel" (electricity) for my Model Y Long Range with nearly all the charges at home, compared to 8 to 11 cents a mile, depending on price and MPG, for a gasoline-powered or ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) car. Admittedly, there are cost-of-ownership issues.
