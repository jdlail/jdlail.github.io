That blogger [Amanda Marcotte](https://beltwayblogroll.nationaljournal.com/archives/2007/02/edwards_campaig.php) resigned under fire from John Edwards' presidential campaign emphasizes what is wrong with public debate in America. It's not about issues and candidates. It's about code words and political correctness. When someone, in this case, Bill Donohue, the president of the Catholic League, points to a blog posting someone made before they joined a campaign and says, this is poltically incorrect, you must go. Something's wrong. I'm not surprised Marcotte is gone; it was the right decision given the circumstances. But it's the new "Did you inhale" question of the MySpace Generation: Did you ever say something dumb, political incorrect or stupid online? And remember, it's still out there ... somewhere. It's an issue for job seekers, political candidates and even the candidates' digital foot soldiers. Of her departure, Marcotte said: "The main good news is that I don’t have a conflict of interest issue anymore that was preventing me from defending myself against these baseless accusations. So it’s on." And so it is.
