Karen Knotts, one of the Book Bandits, has posted a [Chicken & Sausage Jambalaya](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/books/2007/06/my_awardwinning_jambalaya.html#more) recipe that sounds right tasty. She says it came from a "gazillion-year-old Southern Living magazine" and doesn't have anything to do with books at all, except:

That's the deal. It's got to be better than the meatloaf that [Lil' Ed & the Blue Imperials](https://www.intrepidartists.com/liled.html) gets served in "Icicles In My Meatloaf" from last June's [Rattlensake](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=B000FQJPGE&tag=wwwjacklailco-20&index=blended&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwjacklailco-20&l=ur2&o=1) CD, which I was listening to just a bit ago. _I didn't want to rock her boat but there were little icicles in my meatloaf._ Great Chicago slide in a house-rockin' tune. If you've never heard of them, here's the band's [web site](https://www.liledandthebluesimperials.com/). Try 'em both.
