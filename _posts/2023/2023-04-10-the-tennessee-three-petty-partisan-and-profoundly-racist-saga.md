The question I have is was it after the fourth or fifth round at the Good Ole' Boys Bar did it begin to sound like a good idea to bring expulsion resolutions against two young black Democratic lawmakers, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson and one of the few women in the Legislature, Democrat Gloria Johnson?

Because being drunk -- either on Jack or power or both -- is the only explanation that even begins to make sense.

Jones and Pearson were expelled on Thursday while Johnson survived by one vote. That outcome just exacerbated the impression that the actions were racial because Johnson is white.

I spent a big chunk of Thursday watching the YouTube stream from the Tennessee Legislature. The GOP Super Majority were petty, partisan and profoundly racist.

Whether the backlash has any sobering effect remains to be seen.

There is no evidence to suggest it will.

But the actions against the trio dubbed the "Tennessee Three" brought attention to how deliriously intoxicated the majority lawmakers are.
