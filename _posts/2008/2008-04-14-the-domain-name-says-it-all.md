We have a lot of domains registered at knoxnews. Usually, someone will say we've got to register some-really-lame-URL.com because someone else will snatch it up. These are parked safely under lock and key and are unlikely ever to see the address bar of a browser. Consider it a  public service.  
  
And the snatch-it-up part does happen, only we didn't know we wanted that domain until somebody else got it. At that point, it gets expensive to be wishful, we've found.  
  
However, so far we haven't thought of any of these featured in "[Your Domain Says What? 9 Hilariously Misleading Websites](https://www.webupon.com/Web-Talk/Your-Domain-Says-What-9-Hilariously-Misleading-Websites.109049)."
