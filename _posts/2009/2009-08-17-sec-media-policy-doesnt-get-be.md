After reading the new SEC Media Policy and re-reading it, it's becoming clear the revised policy isn't much of an improvement over the restrictive draft policy that was floating around before Friday's official release.  
  
It's like a doctor saying to a patient: "It's not terminal, just fatal."  
  
It heartening to see that the Southeastern Conference's new rules are raising [eyebrows among some lawmakers](https://www.floridatoday.com/content/blogs/gators/2009/08/new-sec-media-policies-angering.shtml).  
  
And in one of the few media corporate public reactions, an attorney for the New York Times, which owns the Gainesville newspaper and others in the Southeast, said the originial rules would have unduly restricted independent news coverage, but with the new rules, the SEC is still trying to dictate editorial judgments that should be left to news organizations.
