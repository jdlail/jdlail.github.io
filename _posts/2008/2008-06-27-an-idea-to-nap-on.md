[![catnapping](/images/kittyNapping2-thumb-150x112.webp)](/images/kittyNapping2.webp)Merlin Mann says he's met [an astonishing number](https://www.43folders.com/2008/06/17/guide-better-napping) of people who can't bring themselves to take naps during the day.  
  
He's never met me.  
  
I don't need a guide and software is unnecessary. TV on, TV off; it doesn't matter. I try not to nap when I'm driving.  
  
But I'm glad Mann's often evangelizing the "transformative power" of a quick nap. Makes me think I'm onto something instead of a slacker.  
  
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_nap) finds a difference between a power nap and a catnap. Seems to me you awake refreshed and recharged from either. Something to dream upon.  
  
Despite feeling groggy around 2 every day, I don't get to nap -- power, cat or otherwise -- at work. But there are some famous people who regularly napped. I found [this list](https://www.fit-life.us/the-power-of-the-power-nap/):  
  
> * Winston Churchill - said he needed his afternoon nap to cope with his responsibilities.  
> * Thomas Edison attributed his tremendous amount of energy to sleeping whenever he wanted to.  
> * John D. Rockefeller took a nap every afternoon in his office.  
> * Eleanor Roosevelt was known to take a nap before a speaking engagement.  
> * William J. Clinton retired to his private quarters every afternoon at 3:00 for a 30-minute nap.  
> * Connie Mack took a nap before every game.  
> * Gene Autry used to take an hour nap in his dressing room between performances.  
> * Ronald Reagan has the ultimate napping reputation even though his wife denies that he had a napping habit.

And Mann point to a [great infographic](https://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/naps/) on Boston.com. Based on it, I'm a lark.  
  
And [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/software/sleep/how-and-why-to-power-nap-297258.php) says "You snooze, you gain."  
  
Do you regularly nap?
