With help from [Tracy Sharp](https://newscoma.wordpress.com/) and [Michael Silence](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/), I did a list of [women bloggers in Tennessee](https://www.knoxnews.com/kns/local_news/article/0,1406,KNS_347_5534815,00.html). It's not billed a complete list, but just a selection of women bloggers in the state that shows varied interests and views of the writers. Lots of good ones to follow. Add 'em to your newsreader. It is a Mother's Day piece of sorts, but I was looking for women bloggers, not women who are mothers or blogging on motherhood.
