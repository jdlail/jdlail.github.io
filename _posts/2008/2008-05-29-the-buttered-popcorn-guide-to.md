An excellent short film by [Eric Faden](https://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/efaden/), an assistant professor of English and film studies at Bucknell about copyright and fair use. It's an extra on a longer DVD being distributed by the [Meida Education Foundation](https://www.mediaed.org/videos/CommercialismPoliticsAndMedia/FreedomOfExpression). There's a [six minute preview](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3n0HiZxDaFQ) of the longer piece. Did you know the song "Happy Birthday to You" is copyrighted?
