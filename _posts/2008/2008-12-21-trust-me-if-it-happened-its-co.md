As I've noted [before](/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=twitter&IncludeBlogs=25&limit=20), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacklail) is a unique communication service that just may be the best innovation in breaking news in the last couple of years. Here's [Loic Le Meur](https://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/12/follow-the-plan.html) on the Denver Continental plane fire last night.

He notes the Twitter user had _better information_ than the official news sources. The Associated Press apparently agreed, also [picking up on the messages](https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AIRPORT_ACCIDENT?SITE=TNKNN&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT) from the Twitter user on the plane in its wire reports:  
  
> Passenger Mike Wilson of Denver described a chaotic scramble to leave the burning plane on updates he posted on Twitter.com from the airport using his cell phone.  
>
> "By the time the plane stopped we were burning pretty well and I think I could feel the heat even through the bulkhead and window," he wrote. "I made for the exit door as quickly as I could, fearing the right wing might explode from the fire. Once out, I scrambled down the wing."
