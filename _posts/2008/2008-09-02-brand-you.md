Mindy McAdams says there's [not much excuse](https://mindymcadams.com/tojou/2008/promote-yourself-well-or-fail/) for a journalist not having an online presence.  
  
> But more important, do you know how to put yourself out there with your blog? Do you link to and comment on other blogs? Do you use your RSS reader and Delicious links as tools to widen your personal sphere of contacts and influence? Ah. That's what I'm talking about.

And this from [Terry Heaton](https://www.thepomoblog.com/archive/are-you-working-on-your-personal-brand/). who says it's critical for journalists to develop their personal brand:  
  
> Let's face it; the day is coming when independent journalists will offer their goods and services to media companies, instead of the companies actually employing them. This is already happening on a small scale, but I expect it will increase as fiscal pressures squeeze the life out of media companies. Hard-working independent contractors can make good money, and it will cost media companies less to purchase their work.
