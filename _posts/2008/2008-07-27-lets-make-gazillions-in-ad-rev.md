It seems if you can get the model right, there is a [revenue growth opportunity](https://www.deepjiveinterests.com/2008/07/26/wait-wait-wait-google-news-makes-how-much-money/) in content even in these tumultuous times.  
  
Leave it to Google (well, we did) to figure out how to make $100 million in advertising revenue from pages with no ads -- or content of its own.  
  
I still find it hard to see how an argument could be made that Google is somehow siphoning away the audience (and ad revenues) of online newspapers. For those that I am aware of, Google is the No. 1 referring domain. And Google News is a highly effective tool for users.
