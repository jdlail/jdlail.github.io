Updated my blogroll today. I manually update this by exporting my Google Reader [OPML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) file to my computer and running a perl script written by [Srijith Krishnan Nair](https://www.srijith.net/codes/index.shtml) against it. Thanks, Sri! Does your blog need to be on my reading list? Let me know.
