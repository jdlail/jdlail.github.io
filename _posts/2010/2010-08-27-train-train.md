OK, Dolly Parton doesn't have anything to do with this, but we should "train, train."  
  
Two training opportunities are coming up that might interest journalists in Tennessee (and elsewhere).  
  
APME's NewsTrain rolls into Nashville, Sept. 23-24.  
  
Some heavy hitters will be on hand:  
  
* KEYNOTE SPEECH ON THURSDAY, SEPT. 23: TOM CURLEY, president and CEO of The Associated Press: "The Renewed Power of the Press"  
  
* KEYNOTE SPEECH ON FRIDAY, SEPT. 24: JOHN SEIGENTHALER, founder of the [First Amendment Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_Center "First Amendment Center"): "The First Amendment, a Cornerstone of Democracy"  
  
See the [full schedule](https://www.apme.com/resource/resmgr/newstrain/nashville_newstrain_agenda.pdf) for the workshop at the John Seigenthaler Center and [register](https://www.apme.com/?page=NashvilleNewsTrain).  
  
A bargain at just $50.  
  
Also at the John Seigenthaler Center is a Multimedia Boot Camp for Journalism Professionals and Educators Nov. 17-21, 2010.  
  
Put on by the  Freedom Forum Diversity Institute, "the multimedia training is tailored for journalists but open to anyone with an interest in multimedia storytelling, regardless of the individual's background. For an additional charge, successful participants can earn 3 college credits. The courses are accredited by the Media Studies Department of Belmont University, which awards the credits."  
  
Tuition is $850. Registration is open until Oct. 31 or until the class is full..
