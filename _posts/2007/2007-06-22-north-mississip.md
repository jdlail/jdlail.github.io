[![From John Battelle's Searchblog](/images/battelleallstars-thumb.webp)](/images/battelleallstars.webp) More on John Battelle's journey to the [North Mississippi hill country](https://battellemedia.com/archives/003760.php). (An earlier post is [here](https://battellemedia.com/archives/003734.php).) Battelle is a Silicon Valley icon who was a founder of Wired magazine, a founder of The Industry Standard, wrote _the book_ on Google. He is an entrepreneurial journalist who started and runs a blog business called Federated Media and is an authoritative source on search engines from his [Searchblog](https://battellemedia.com/) perch. But on a hot June day in the back woods of the Deep South:

> I realized that beyond the time I spent with my children, or the moments I steal with my wife, I had found a place where the incessant question we all seem driven by was answered. What else might I be doing?

He's got it right with the [North Mississippi All-Stars](https://www.nmallstars.com/), who have a [DVD](https://northmississippiallstars.shop.musictoday.com/Dept.aspx?cp=406_11424) coming out on June 26.
