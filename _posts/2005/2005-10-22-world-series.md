I'm going with the Astros. Got [Phil Garner](https://houston.astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/team/coach_staff_bio.jsp?c_id=hou&coachorstaffid=623104173435) (former Bearden High School standout, UT star and Jefferson City native) and [Chis Burke](https://houston.astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/team/player.jsp?player_id=429663) ( a great player at Tennessee in 2001). Our sons, of course, are going with the White Sox. Mark says White Sox in four. I think we'll see Game 7.
