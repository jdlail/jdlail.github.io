An East Tennessee blogger spent a day at the News Sentinel recently and has posted "[A Blogger Visits the MSM. Part 1: The Fourth Estate Goes Commercial](https://shotsacrossthebow.com/archives/002541.html)." It looks like he plans seven parts. Are we that interesting? I doubt The News Sentinel is anywhere near as entertaining as Bravo's reality TV show ["Tabloid Wars](https://www.bravotv.com/Tabloid_Wars//index.shtml)" about the New York Daily News that aired during the summer. But blogger Rich Hailey seemed to find it pretty fascinating and he did ask a lot of the right questions. Take a look at his first post.
