![J.P. Morgan](/images/250px-Jpmorgan.webp)I don't have any particular angst about Google. In fact, i love the company's products and am a heavy user. Among my favs are Google search, Google Reader, Google Docs, Picasa, GrandCentral, Google tools for Webmasters, Google Analytics, and Google Apps for your domain. Wonderful stuff.  
  
But sometimes the company does remind me of a railroad in the Robber Baron era.

Maybe, it's just me. Certainly Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan, Vanderbilt, Gould and [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_%28industrialist%29) would be proud.
