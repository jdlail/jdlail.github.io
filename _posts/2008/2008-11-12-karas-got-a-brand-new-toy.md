[Kara Swisher](https://kara.allthingsd.com/20081112/a-new-flip-joins-the-boomtown-video-family-high-def-hijinks-ensue/) at WSJ's BoomTown has a new HD Flip video camera.

I can get behind that one! I haven't seen the HD version on Amazon yet so I'm assuming the BoomTown folks have a review one from the company.  
  
Katherine Boehret did a [helpful review](https://solution.allthingsd.com/20081111/flip-camcorder-goes-high-def/) as well.  
  
I'm a big fan of the Flip cameras (which are used in the Knoxville News Sentinel newsroom on a daily basis) and have written about it some:  
  
* [Flip HD](/2008/10/flip-hd.html)
* [Pat Boone gives a Flip interview](/2008/09/pat-boone-gives-a-flip-intervi.html)
* [It's the journalism, stupid](/2008/07/its-the-journalism-stupid.html)
* [The Zen of Flip](/2008/03/the-zen-of-flip.html)
* [Small camera video](/2008/01/small-camera-video.html)

If you're still scoffing at these cameras, you should try one for awhile and see if it meets the "good enough" test.
