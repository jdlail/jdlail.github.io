And you thought it was Apple. Silly you.  
  
Samsung doesn't think so and its [attorneys have set out to prove that](https://paidcontent.org/article/419-apple-samsung-dispute-likely-to-turn-on-1994-knight-ridder-tablet/).  
  
Who invented the iPad? Maybe onetime newspaper goliath [Knight-Ridder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Ridder "Knight Ridder").  
  
Here's tablet, digital paper pioneer [Roger Fidler](https://www.rjionline.org/people/roger-fidler) talking in the 1990s about a tablet whose vision is remarkably similar to the iPad of today. Fidler's big problem in 1994. He thought it was just a tablet newspaper. Had he thought of Angry Birds and iTunes, the history of tech and the fortunes of the newspaper chain he worked for might have turned out vastly different.
