It's outrageous that a school board and a state school board association would base efforts to limit cameras at public meeting on an attorney general's opinion that has been declared unconstitutional.  
  
But that's what the Loudon County (Tenn.) Board of Education [would like to do](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/sep/01/loudon-board-seeks-control-of-cameras-in/).  
  
It would be interesting to see how that is explained in a civics class.  
  
Being an school board member is thankless task, but it's also a good place to learn that governing in a democracy is just plain messy. That's the picture.
