[![The Cottars, click to see larger image](/thecottars-thumb.jpg)](/thecottars.jpg) Wow, what an impressive sounding album from a pair of sisters and brothers from Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. I got their new album, _Forerunner_ , a few days ago and it's really nice. And it's the band's third.

The first came out in 2002 and they seem to have been together since 2000. _Forerunner_ is their U.S. debut album. The Cottars are four teens: two girls 16 and two guys 18. Ciarán and Fiona MacGillivray are the children of Canadian author/composer, Allister MacGillivray. The other half of the group is Roseanne and Jimmy MacKenzie.

Find out more about them on their [Web site](https://www.thecottars.com/). You can also hear a few songs from the new CD on their [MySpace site](https://www.myspace.com/cottars) (I wonder why they didn't post those on their Web site). If you like a Celtic-influenced sound, you'll enjoy this group.

I hope they come to the Tennessee Theater sometime. I particularly liked their versions of "Send Me a River" and "Hold On." Have you heard these four?
