[![Glenn Reynolds](/assets_c/2008/09/mepjtv-thumb-150x100.webp)](/images/mepjtv.webp)Glenn Reynolds, a blogging pioneer, may be marking a new trail in the electronic wilderness, this time to Internet-only TV.  
  
He's doing commentary this week at the Republican National Convention for [Pajamas TV](https://www.pjtv.com/), a part of [Pajamas Media](https://www.pajamasmedia.com/), where he hosts his hugely popular [Instapundit](https://www.instapundit.com/) blog.

[Read more](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/sep/03/instapundit-star-now-rnc-talking-head/) about this effort. As he notes, Internet TV costs are a fraction of what it costs to do a broadcast quality TV show, a fact that makes Pajamas TV potentially disruptive as hell to cable channels and broadcast TV.  
  
At knoxnews, we're working with a company called [Wazoo Sports](https://www.wazoosports.com/) that is similarly potentially disruptive in high school preps coverage.
