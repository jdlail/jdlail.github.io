We bought one of these [Pure Digital point-and-shoot video cameras](https://www.puredigitalinc.com/products/pandsvideo/index.html). Seems to be an awesome value in a simple-is-good package. Anyone one else tried them for news video? We're hoping to arm reporters with them for Web video. It's the easiest point and shoot video I've ever seem. Any feedback appreciated.
