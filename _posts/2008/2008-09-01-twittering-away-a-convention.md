A couple good RNC Twitters I've noticed in my Twitter stream: the Rocky Mountain News' [M.E. Sprengelmeyer](https://twitter.com/RMN_ME) and [William Beutler](https://twitter.com/williambeutler) of "[Blog, P.I.](https://www.blogpi.net/)" fame.  
  
And [CSPAN](https://twitter.com/cspan) notes it has has a page of [convention Twitter postings](https://rnc08.c-span.org/?page_id=9) based on posts with the [hashtag](https://hashtags.org/) of #mc08.  
  
Who's your favorite Twitterer at the Republican Convention?
