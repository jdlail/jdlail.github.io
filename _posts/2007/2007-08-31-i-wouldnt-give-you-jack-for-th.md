Naming rights for a person?  
  
That's a new one.  
  
But Stan Oleynick, a 23-year-old Sacramento, CA., is taking bids on his Web site, [holdmyrecord.com](https://www.holdmyrecord.com/), to rename himself.  
  
It's a ploy to raise money for his start up. The winner also gets a 10 percent stake in the fledgling company, which may release its "revolutionary" product in September  
  
Oleynick promises to try to break a Guinness Book record to get his new name some good pub.  
  
And you can buy it now for $250,000 or bid on it. The current top bid is $16,000.  
  
It was crazy enough to get me to write about it.
