Bill Tallent, CEO of [Mercury Intermedia](https://www.mercuryintermedia.com/), talks about how Apple's iPad will transform culture. His company is a maker of applications for iPhone, iTouch, iPad and Android devices. The iPad application it built for USA Today has been getting rave reviews.  
  
Tallent, a fascinating serial entrepreneur, spoke Friday, April 9, 2010, at the "Smart Phones for Smart Journalists" workshop held at the John Seigenthaler Center in Nashville, Tenn., on the edge of the Vanderbilt University campus.  
  
The day-long workshop was sponsored by the Online News Association and the Freedom Forum Diversity Institute and was underwritten in part by Cell Journalist, a Nashville company with a photo and video platfrom used by hundreds of media Web sites, and the Scripps Howard Foundation.  
  
Here is a link to Tallent's [slide deck](https://www.slideshare.net/jacklail/impact-of-fourth-generation-computers).

Unfortunately, I missed getting Ray Meese, photo director of the Ventura County Star, who gave an amazing presentation on tools and applications that you can use to shoot, edit and upload videos with the iPhone.
