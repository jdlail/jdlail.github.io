Bloggers will be the salvation of newspapers -- or something like that -- from Dave Winer. Another [post](https://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/05/23/whatIsWeb30.html) where a "tech guy" is a more optimistic about the newspaper buisness and mainstream media biz than many in it.

> It would be a waste of a tradition, of a good coral reef, if newspapers really died. They need to change, and imho, when that change happens, we will safely be in the era of Web 3.0
