> How does a democracy work without (in-depth) news? It doesn't. While most of the population will not care about access to high-quality news, there are always some who read to find out what's really going on, and why. Dictatorships, totalitarian regimes and underdeveloped countries don't have the luxury of investigative journalism, and the news-as-entertainment in highly capitalist regimes isn't really informative either -- it's bread and circuses. An informed citizenry, said Jefferson, is necessary for a democracy to function.
