John Ndege [blogs the demise](https://johnndege.com/2008/03/31/the-problem-with-citizen-journalism/) of his London-based ScribbleSheet citizen journalism site, which launched last September, in a post titled "The Problem with Citizen Journalism.".  
  
Ndege has some observations.  
  
Among them, he thinks [NowPublic](https://www.nowpublic.com/local) may have a potentially sucessful model, particularly as a result of its [agreement](https://www.nowpublic.com/ap_and_nowpublic_com_announce_a_collaboration) with the Associated Press.  
  
ScribbleSheet is another in a long stream of examples of the how very tough it is to build a successful community model -- as a business.  
  
One of Ndege's hard learnings: _Simple display advertising won't cut it._  
  
That calls into question the business models of a large number of sites.
