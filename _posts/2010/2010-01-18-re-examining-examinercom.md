A follow up to my [Dec. 21 post](/2009/12/why-examinercoms-traffic-is-gr.html) about Examiner.com's success at SEO, ranking high in Google searches and ballooning traffic: It seems the site has been at least temporarily banned from [Google News](https://www.google.com/support/forum/p/news/thread?tid=7856b33f93a0ae37&hl=en).  
  
Hat tip to Examiner.com contributor [Elizabeth Kelly](https://www.examiner.com/x-7386-Knoxville-Healthy-Food-Examiner) for making me aware of that news.  
  
I'm not sure what rules infraction got the site bumped from Google News, but I still believe traditional news media sites could learn something from watching it, particularly its ability to rank high in organic search results.
