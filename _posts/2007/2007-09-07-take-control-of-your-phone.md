I agree with [Merlin Mann](https://www.43folders.com/2007/09/07/grand-central/) that GrandCentral's feature set holds a lot of potential for managing phone contact. I wish Comcast would steal a few of these ideas and my work phone acted _a lot more_ like it.  
  
That said, anyone who has had the same phone number for a long time may find it hard to get friends, family and business/professional contacts to switch to the GrandCentral number.
