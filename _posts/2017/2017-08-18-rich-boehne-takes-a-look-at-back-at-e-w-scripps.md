Rich Boehne has stepped down as CEO of the E.W. Scripps company. Here's a look back in an [article on the Scripps-owned WCPO website](https://www.wcpo.com/news/insider/leaders-eat-last-how-rich-boehne-reshaped-ew-scripps-co?sharedToken=956958a3-0262-415e-98a2-69054959d230). Ken Lowe, CEO of Knoxville-based Scripps Networks Interactive said:

> “I don’t think his goal was to ever exit the newspaper business. His idea was to figure out a way to get through the transition so the Scripps name would still be recognized as a force in journalism … so, I don’t say this lightly. I’m not sure there would be an E.W. Scripps if Rich had not stepped in after we split. When you look at the cards Rich was dealt back in 2008 and the way he’s played them, I just don’t think anybody could have done a better job.” https://soundcloud.com/wcpo-9-on-your-side/boehne-on-exiting-newspapers
