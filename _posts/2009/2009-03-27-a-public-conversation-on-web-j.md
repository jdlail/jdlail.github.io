A fascinating group of media folks _(well, excluding yours truly, who is decidedly non-fascinating to put it charitably),_ are participating next Wednesday in a "Public Conversation on Web Journalism"  at the [Howard H. Baker Center](https://bakercenter.utk.edu/main/) (Toyota Auditorium) from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

This group will be speaking with 50 to 75 University of Tennessee students. I'm sure we'll learn something from them.
