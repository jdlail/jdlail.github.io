![Katie Allison Granju](/images/082208katie.webp)One of my favorite Knoxville voices has a new blog project. See Katie Allison Granju's "[Because I said so](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/granju/)."  
  
And sure, she's maintaining her well-known [personal blog](https://www.katieallisongranju.com/). Before leaving WBIR for a new job with the E.W. Scripps corporate interactive office in Knoxville, Katie launched and grew [Knoxvilletalks.com](https://knoxvilletalks.com/),  a very fresh and vibrant approach to creating, highlighting and linking to interesting conversations in Knoxville and Tennessee.  
  
I'm glad to have such a talented blogger working with us at [knoxnews](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/) on a blog project. Read her; it'll be interesting.
