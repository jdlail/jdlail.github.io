[Photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chenoweth/2912293444/in/set-72157605556133067/) by Paul Chenoweth. His factoid: If you placed all of the wiring in the Media Filing Tent end-to-end and repeated that 88 times...it would extend from Nashville to Moscow, Russia.  
  
He's [documenting](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chenoweth/sets/72157605556133067/) all the activity in getting ready for the persidential debate at Belmont University on flickr. Some wonderful behind the scenes photos there.  
  
He also has been [twittering](https://twitter.com/bruingeek/) about the setup work today.
