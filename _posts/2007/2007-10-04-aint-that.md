[![20th Century Fox](/images/205hcenturyfox-thumb-150x63.webp)](/images/205hcenturyfox.webp)Has this happened to you?  
  
At knoxnews, we post a lot of our videos on YouTube, especially those done by our TV critic (they get a lot more traffic there than on our site).  
  
However, we recently received this email from YouTube.

Ok, this is a video that our writer shot. It wasn't shot on a movie or TV set. It's not a bootleg movie or even a movie trailer. It's journalism; it's an interview!  
  
Here's the offending [clip](https://wms.scripps.com/knoxville/entertainment/0116video_terry_reno.wmv) in Windows Media (WMV) format.  
  
What's up with that?  
  
It makes me think that the garish cigar-chomping studio bosses of yore would like come back as the studio bosses of the Internet. But the studio system ended sometime back in the 20th century, right? Maybe not at 20th Century Fox.  
  
Now, that's retarded.
