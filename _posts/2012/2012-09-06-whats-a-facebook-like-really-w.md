The Social Media Day at the Associated Press Media Editors Conference in Nashville has one panel that will attempt to provide some answers to that question. It's a star-studded lineup of newspaper and TV digital pioneers, who have been innovators and ground-breakers as traditional media expanded into digital.  
  
Social Media Day is Friday, Sept. 21 at the John Seigenthaler Center on the campus of Vanderbilt University. APME is doing a [special one-day rate](/2012/08/get-deal-on-apmes-social-media.html) of $35 for editors, broadcasters and journalism educators who would like to attend just that day. Contact [Sally Jacobsen](SJacobsen@ap.org) or [Adam Yeomans](mailto:ayeomans@ap.org) if you are interested. There are [two great morning panels](/2012/08/youre-likely-to-first-find-out-1.html), a lunch speaker and an aftenroon panel, plus an update from a couple Associated Press political writers fresh from the campaign trail.  
  
It would be worth $35 just to hear this panel, but there's still time to sign up for the [whole Conference](https://www.apme.com/?page=2012Conference), which starts on Wednesday. Sept. 19. All three days are filled with great sessions and speakers and events. And the John Seigenthaler Center is a fabulous facility.  
  
The title for this panel is "Is There More to Social Media Than Being Liked?" and the panelists will tackle why are we tweeting and hanging out on Facebook when we have a newspaper to put out - and with fewer people. What are the best ways to make social media campaigns effective? How do you measure social media effectiveness, and what are some strategies for using social media to engage more deeply audiences that might help  generate revenue.  
  
Here's a look at the panelists.
