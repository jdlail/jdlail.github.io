Have you tried the alpha [FOIA Machine](https://www.foiamachine.org/)?

It's from the [Center for Investigative Reporting](https://cironline.org/) with funding from the Knight Foundation (some $47,000) and a Kickstarter campaign? Investigative reporter Djordje Padejski [got the project going](https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/07/foia-machine/).

Here are some [tips on using it](https://www.ire.org/blog/car-conference-blog/2014/03/18/sunshine-week-tips-using-foia-machine/?utm_source=API%27s+Need+to+Know+newsletter&utm_campaign=7709cdcbc2-Need_to_Know_March_19_20143_18_2014&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e3bf78af04-7709cdcbc2-31694061).

The Center for Investigative Reporting [calls the FOIA machine](https://cironline.org/foiaproject) the "TurboTax for government records."
