[![Knox County Cell Calls on AT&T](/assets_c/2011/07/knoxvillecellcalls-thumb-485x321-648.webp)](/images/knoxvillecellcalls.webp)

This screen shot shows where Knox County AT&T mobile phone users call in total minutes from aggregated, anonymous AT&T data. It's a [cool interactive map](https://senseable.mit.edu/csa/interact.html), you can look up counties and view by call minutes or number of text messages. (Click on the image to see a larger version.)  
  
It's part of a [MIT research project](https://senseable.mit.edu/csa/), the Connected States of America.
