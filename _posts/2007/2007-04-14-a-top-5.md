This is a [good list](https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/1/07bestplaces_Best-Places-For-Business-And-Careers_land.html) for Knoxville to be in the Top 5 on for the [second year](https://www.knoxnews.com/kns/business/article/0,1406,KNS_376_5466843,00.html) in a row.

  1. Raleigh NC
  2. Provo UT
  3. Boise ID
  4. Des Moines IA
**
  5. Knoxville TN
**
  6. Albuquerque NM
  7. Durham NC
  8. Fayetteville AR
  9. Nashville TN
  10. Olympia WA

It's Forbes Best Places For Business And Careers list in the April 5 print edition. Here's the [Knoxville page](https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/1/07bestplaces_Knoxville-TN_2546.html). Johnson City comes in at No. 10 in the small metros. A poll on the Forbes sites ask where you like to start a business and Raleigh wins hands down with about 24 percent of the votes. Everybody else comes in third or worse behind "None of the above." _Thank god_ the area is still somewhat of a secret.
