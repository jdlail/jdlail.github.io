[![South of Athens](/assets_c/2009/06/060509athens-thumb-250x176-472.webp)](/images/060509athens.webp)[Lido Vizzutti](https://www.flatheadbeacon.com/articles/article/what_can_professionals_lear_from_students/10871/) takes a look at an Ohio University student journalism project, [Soul of Athens](https://2009.soulofathens.com/). Pretty good stuff.  
  
The "about" page describes the project as:  
  
> Soul of Athens is an innovative online publication that studies the contrasts of this Appalachian county through a collection of timeless stories and multimedia presentations. The project gives voice to a diverse group of individuals intertwined by a common sense of place through stories that resonate universally.  
>

But it might be best described as cool stories about real people living in the Athens area. Explore it a bit.
