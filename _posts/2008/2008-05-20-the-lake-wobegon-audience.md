[Nielsen's @Plan](https://www.naa.org/blog/digitaledge/1/2008/05/Nielsen-Plan-Newspaper-Sites-Attract-Affluent-Politically-Interested-Visitors.cfm):  
  
* Those who visit newspaper Web sites are more likely to have household incomes greater than $100,000, when compared to people who visit other sites online. Those who visit newspaper Web sites are also more likely to be in professional/managerial positions.
* Newspaper Web site visitors are significantly more likely to seek out political/campaign information online.
* Those who visit newspaper Web sites are more likely to be online shoppers, especially for travel and vehicles.

Analysis with apologies to Garrison Keillor. Newspaper Web sites are "where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average."
