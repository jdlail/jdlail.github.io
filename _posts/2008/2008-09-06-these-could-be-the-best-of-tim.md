> "It's a terrific time for journalists to take their career into their own hands. It's always been a very passive career ... you move up from market to market and you don't have to retrain yourself. But if you take the time to retrain, if you learn the new skills -- and it's not a matter of new skills for journalism, those rules stay the same -- you throw yourself to the front of the pack."
