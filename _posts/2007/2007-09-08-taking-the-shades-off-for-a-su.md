The News Sentinel's decision to recruit some bloggers to help cover its Sunshine suit against the County Commissioners is drawing some react.  
  
Editor Jack McElroy [outlines the plan in his Sunday column](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/editor/2007/09/how_well_cover_sunshine_suit.shtml), which was posted on his blog Friday evening. He's trying to address the thorny issue of covering yourself in a new way, sort of crowd-sourcing a story in which the newspaper is a player. He said:  
  
> To provide independent scrutiny of our coverage, however, we also put out a request among local bloggers for volunteers to monitor our reports. Three bloggers stepped forward. Happily, they span the political spectrum.  
>
> On occasion, we may also publish excerpts from these blogs in the print edition

[Randy Neal](https://www.knoxviews.com/node/5832), who's been doing a lot of coverage of the suit and open meetings issues at his popular Knoxviews site, said: "its an interesting experiment in citizen journalism. I'm not sure a newspaper has ever done anything like this before. Once again, the KNS is way out front in working with the the local blogger community."  
  
[Enclave](https://enclave-nashville.blogspot.com/2007/09/news-sentinel-editor-concedes-bias.html), a Nashville blog, said; "The fact that Mr. McElroy is utilizing bloggers is fine, but more remarkable is a rare concession from a paper that its relationship to a particular subject can adversely affect its claims to objectivity. I am impressed."  
  
And northwest Tennessee journalist and blogger Trace Sharp ([Newscoma](https://www.newscoma.com/)), posting on [Music City Bloggers](https://www.musiccitybloggers.com/2007/09/08/breaking-news-on-tennessee-blogging/), may have captured it: "Campers, this is HUGE."  
  
The three bloggers that stepped up to give this a try ([Dave Oatney](https://oatneyworld.blogspot.com/), [Rich Hailey](https://www.shotsacrossthebow.com/weblog/) and [Russ McBee](https://russmcbee.com/default.aspx)) are independent as hell, politically diverse from one another and can cogently put their thoughts to blog.  
   
As one of the bloggers, Russ McBee wrote on this [blog](https://russmcbee.com/archive/2007/08/30/watching-the-watchers.aspx), "Stay tuned. This will be interesting."  
  
Yes, indeed.
