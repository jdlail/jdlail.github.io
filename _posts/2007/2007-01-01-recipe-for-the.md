A youth play: Food! So says BusinessWeek in its Jan. 8, 2007, issue in [story](https://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_02/b4016082.htm) about how the [Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/) is attracting the youth market. Course it may not be all about heatin' up the stove. The story quotes a 21-year-old Binghamton University student who says he and his buddies are into Giada De Laurentiis, the _Everyday Italian_ host, and record her so they don't miss episodes. The same guy says he and his buddies are into the Food Network for cooking tips, too: "Any time a girl sees guys cooking something delicious, it definitely helps out." Young women also are taking a greater interest in cooking, the article notes. A Scripps Networks exec did say there were no plans to MTV-ize the Food Network. Food for thought: Winning the youth audience isn't about the hokey features and dumbed-down content that often pass for "youth content." If cooking shows can attract a young audience, then lots of topics have the potential too -- with the right ingredients.
