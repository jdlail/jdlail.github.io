The New York Times [has discovered](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/us/04land.html?ref=us) Knox County politics.  
  
Gotta say they Dan Barry nailed it. Some of the vivid observations:  
  
> It seems a catfish could have been appointed if properly connected.  
>

Wasn't there at least one?  
  
> The county's public officials helped to propel the reform movement just by being themselves.  
>

Most of them have a hard time escaping that.  
  
> Knox County of 2008 brings to mind the last scene of "Meet John Doe," Frank Capra's populist melodrama of 1941. The wiry newspaper editor turns to the just-thwarted political boss and, with great exclamation, says: "There you are, Norton, the people. Try and lick that!"

We'll see Tuesday.
