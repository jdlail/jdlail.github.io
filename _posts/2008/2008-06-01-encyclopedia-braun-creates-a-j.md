Want a human filtered stream of blog postings from selected new-media-and-journalism blogs? [Josh](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/4/380/) [Braun](https://wideaperture.net/?page_id=36), a journalist, researcher and teaching assistant at Cornell University, has [created one](https://wideaperture.net/understudy/blog/2008/05/30/nifty-rss-selected-content-from-30-journalism-new-media-blogs-in-one-feed/).  He says:  
  
> "I've created a combined RSS feed, not of this site, but of around 30 cool new-media-and-journalism blogs from around the web.  It will send out about 10 to 15 posts per day, and I'll filter out off-topic posts, so you won't have to read about career advice for young journalists, or what someone ate for breakfast."
