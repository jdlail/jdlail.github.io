Did the TN legislature become the first living brain donors? <https://t.co/F4ae3qb> | cc [@jacklail](https://twitter.com/jacklail) [@jeffjarvis](https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis) [#photog](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23photog)[Sat Jun 11 18:23:36](https://twitter.com/gizmotastic/status/79614777378344960 "Sat Jun 11 18:23:36 ") via web[![](https://a2.twimg.com/profile_images/1123219962/jeffmanes_normal.jpg)](https://twitter.com/gizmotastic)**[Jeff Manes](https://twitter.com/gizmotastic)**

Michael Silence has a roundup of reaction to a new [Tennessee law that outlaws images](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/silence/archives/2011/06/tns_unconstitut.shtml) that, well, you might find "frighten, intimidate or cause emotional distress."  
  
The drafters of the bill were apparently hoping to update the statutes regarding [cyber bullying](https://www.stopcyberbullying.org/), which laudable, but many commentators on the new law say it went too far and is unconstitutional.  
  
Cari Wade Gervin says take a deep breath, it's not you won't run afoul of the law unless you're a "[crazy creepy cyberstalker](https://blogs.metropulse.com/the_daily_pulse/2011/06/offensive-internet-pictures-ar.html)."  
  
I doubt we'll have to wait long to find the first person to run afoul of this. Frankly, quite a few Faceobook profile pics frighten me.  
  
This is the same Legislature that made sharing [Netflix passwords illegal](https://mashable.com/2011/06/03/tennessee-illegal-sharing-netflix/).Thankfully, lawmakers are out of sessions and can't pass any more bills to fix the Internet for awhile.
