I thought newsroom colleague Michael Silence had a good [post](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/silence/archives/2006/05/recovery_and_so.shtml) Friday on how hard it is to kick the smoking habit even after a heart bypass operation. It seemed to strike chord with some. Several commenters had their own tales to share.
