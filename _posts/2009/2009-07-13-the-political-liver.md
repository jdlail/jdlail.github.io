[Glenn Reynolds](https://www.instapundit.com/) thinks health care delivery might get easily entwined in politics as a result of a large government presence in health care reform. "I don't want someone looking to see who I have donated campaign money to before they decide if I get a liver transplant. And If you don't think that's not going to happen, you haven't been paying attention," he said Sunday during a radio call-in show in Knoxville.  
  
Reynolds, Michael Silence and I were on George Korda's show on WNOX.  
  
The column mentioned in the video he wrote for the Washington Examiner on [the hidden cost of national health care is here](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/OpEd-Contributor/The-hidden-cost-of-national-health-care-7952906-50469092.html).  
  
Plausible?
