The technology Ron Sylvester utilized in covering a trial in Kansas may made the special agents of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation envious. If you work at newspaper, you should be, too.  
  
Not because he had the fanciest and most expensive gear available (he didn't, but it was good stuff), but because he and the Wichita Eagle were able to cobble together low-tech and high-tech in a way that allowed unique coverage.  
  
He explains in [this posting](https://www.spj.org/blog/blogs/tech/archive/2007/11/14/10033.aspx).  
  
Do you have reporters who have never emailed in a story with their Blackberry? Do have people who say you can't do without expensive gizmos? Are computer skills lacking?  
  
What I found most encouraging is they just tried it.  
  
Try it Ron's way and see what happens.
