If local newspapers can't win local search, what's there for them to own? We in newspapers better figure this one out. The whole advertising/audience economy of online newspapers depends on it. One of the solutions in Pramit Sigh's post (and he has several excellent ones) is to give reporters blogs (and we're back to this evening's earlier [post)](/2007/01/blogging_on_blo.html).
