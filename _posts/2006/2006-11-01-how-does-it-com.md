Search engine Compete.com has a new domain traffic comparison [tool](https://snapshot.compete.com/knoxnews.com). Anybody got a clue if this any more accurate than the more-probably-than-not wrong [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/site)? The results, I guess, can only be considered relative to other sites. Instead of cookies, IP addresses, etc., they are using a "Consumer-based community." Here's how knoxnews [stacks up](https://snapshot.compete.com/knoxnews.com/?domain2=wbir.com&domain3=) against the big TV in town (WBIR). The site does address how it and Alexa [differ](https://www.compete.com/help#snp3). Worth watching ... _maybe_. Fun playing with ..._definitely_.
