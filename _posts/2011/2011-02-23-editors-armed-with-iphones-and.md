Last week, [E.W. Scripps](https://www.scripps.com/) editors, website managers, and corporate interactive folks (among others) took a break from strategic planning in a windowless hotel conference room in Orlando to tour the [Kennedy Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html "Kennedy Space Center").  
  
It was part of the work being done for the launch of a new space site, which officially debuts Thursday. It's live now, however, with a lot of work still going on.  
  
As part of the site launch, there will be lots of live coverage on the site of the [Discovery shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Discovery "Space Shuttle Discovery") launch, set for 4:50 p.m., including live streaming of the liftoff and a live chat. It's the last space flight of the Discovery.  
  
The video above, mostly shot with the camera in the iPhone, is from the tour.  
  
Give the site a look. It's [www.spacetimesnews.com](https://www.spacetimesnews.com/) and if you have suggestions, let me know. I will pass them on. Part of the purpose of the site is to give a place to try out a few new things.
