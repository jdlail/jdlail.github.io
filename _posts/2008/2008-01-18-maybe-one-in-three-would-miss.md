From a [SearchEngineLand](https://searchengineland.com/080118-101338.php) take on the 2008 Digital Future survey from the Center For The Digital Future at Southern Cal:  
  
> **Would You Miss the Print Edition of Your Newspaper?** \-- In a new question, respondents who read print editions of newspapers were asked if they would miss the offline edition if it was no longer available. While more than half of respondents (52 percent) expressed some level of agreement with this question, 27 percent disagreed.

Another factoid of note from the highlights:  
  
> **Eighty percen** t of Internet users age 17 and older consider the Internet to be an important source of information for them -- up from 66 percent in 2006 -- and higher than television (68 percent), radio (63 percent), and newspapers (63 percent).
