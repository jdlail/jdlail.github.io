The YouTube effect on the presidential campaigns continues to be among the more interesting innovations in the 2008 campaign.  
  
Fred Thompson used [YouTube effectively](/2007/11/fred-thompson-savvy-internet-c.html) \-- maybe he thought he was going to run from the YouTube video "porch?"  
  
Then there was Justin Dylan and Will.i.am's "[Yes We Can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY)" video.  
  
Now here's a very funny video from Jack Nicholson called "Jack and Hill" composed of clips of from his films.  
  
The video, which was not coordinated with the Hillary Clinton campaign, was posted early Saturday.  
  
From [Showbiz Spy](https://www.showbizspy.com/2008/03/02/jack-nicholson-shows-his-support-for-hillary-clinton-in-you-tube-film/):  
  
> He says: "There is nothing on this earth sexier - believe me gentleman - than a woman you have to salute in the morning."  
>
> Hollywood director Rob Reiner put the video together on Nicholson's behalf and the actor appears at the end to say: "I'm Jack Nicholson and I endorse this message."
