The [Tennessee Valley Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Valley_Authority "Tennessee Valley Authority") has a propensity for a disaster at least annually based solely on bad decision-making. Maybe [this is it](https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/may/13/duncan-wamp-say-public-has-right-agencys-informati/) ... and these guys run nuclear plants.  

The agency, a relic of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal "New Deal"), seems conflicted today on whether it's even part of the government.
