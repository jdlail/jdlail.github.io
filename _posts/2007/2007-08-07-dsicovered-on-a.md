![Sen. Barack Obama waits for a question in Adel, Iowa. Photo by M.E. Sprengelmeyer.](/images/barackobamaoutstanding.webp)I recently discovered the Rocky Mountain News' M.E. Sprengelmeyer was doing a presidential campaign blog called "Back Roads to the White House." It's been a fresh read on the campaign. Take his [McStrategy](https://blogs.rockymountainnews.com/denver/sprengelmeyer/archives/2007/08/the_supersized_campaign.html) post. Hadn't read that one before. What first caught my eye were the photos he's taking and he's a writer; not a photographer. Yet he's capturing what it's like between sound bites. But maybe what was most interesting is how I found it -- from a Facebook [group](https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2625863722) he created. This evening he had 58 photos posted in his Facebook group. Some are calling Facebook the [new business card](https://scobleizer.com/2007/07/28/calacanis-cant-keep-up-with-facebook/); maybe it's the new portfolio?
