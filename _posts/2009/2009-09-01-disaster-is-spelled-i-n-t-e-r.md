Lauren Rich Fine on [what has happened](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-maloney/tribune-decline-of-a-medi_b_273938.html):  
  
> "Traditional media failed to realize the competitive challenge created by the Internet as it allows all media to compete directly and without any competitive advantage," said Lauren Rich Fine, a former media analyst at Merrill Lynch and now a Practitioner in Residence at Kent State University's College of Communication and Information. "Now there is excess supply of both news/entertainment content and ad space, which combined with slower demand, due to the economy, is spelling disaster."

She may not be working on Wall Street as a top media analyst anymore, but the business acumen is still well-honed.
