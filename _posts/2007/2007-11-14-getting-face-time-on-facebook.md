Inspired by how easy Greg Sterling [made it look](https://gesterling.wordpress.com/2007/11/13/building-local-business-pages-on-facebook/), I created a simple business presence on Facebook for the [Knoxville News Sentinel](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=18884137648). Click the link and add it to your "stores." (Stores has to be another in a long line of inane terms Facebook forces one to use. Also, there was no business type in its options for a news or media business. Geez.) UPDATE: Well, I recreated it as a "brand or product," but anyway.  
  
As Sterling demonstrates with screen shots, it's dead simple. Figuring out how to promote it short of a bunch of cajoles and a cache of plastic cash  with Facebook ads; not so simple.  I couldn't convince it to take my corporate credit card; Facebook sniffed nose at Old Media Cash.  
  
Charlene Li of Forrester fame makes the [business case](https://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2007/11/by-charlene-li-.html) for being on Facebook and MySpace.  
  
Knoxnews' online producers have a [MySpace page](https://www.myspace.com/randomthis) for their [RandomThis](https://www.knoxnews.com/randomthis) videos and there is one for our Friday entertainment section, [Preview](https://www.myspace.com/preview_knoxville).
