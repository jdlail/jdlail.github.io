[Charlene Li](https://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2008/07/why-im-leaving.html), who announced today she's leaving Forrester Resarch, says:

Based on that I'm like a way overdue library book hiding under the old magazines. But, yeah, I have a [new title](https://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/editor/2008/07/region_news_reorganization_at.shtml), a redefined role, a new place to sit, and I'm into FACTS.  
  
Ask me in 18 months if I have it down to a routine.
