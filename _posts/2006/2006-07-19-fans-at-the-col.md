[![KnoxNews on The Colbert Report -- click to see larger version](/colbertshow_the_word-thumb.jpg)](/colbertshow_the_word.jpg)  
I learned today that a screen grab from KnoxNews was used last night on The Word segment of The Colbert Report. Here's the [video](https://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/?lnk=v&ml_video=71890) from Comedy Center's Web Site. The segment was about "It's time for management and labor to come together as management to exploit labor." Don't know how they came to find our version of this state AP [story](https://www.knoxnews.com/kns/business/article/0,1406,KNS_376_4840001,00.html), but, hey,that's OK. Thanks to Randy Neal at [KnoxViews](https://www.knoxviews.com/node/1539) for noticing this! _(You can click the photo to see a larger version of the image above.)_ Tags: [Colbert Report](https://technorati.com/tag/Colbert Report) | [Stephen Colbert](https://technorati.com/tag/Colbert Report)
