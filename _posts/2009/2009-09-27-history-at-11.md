![Google at 11](/images/11th_birthday.gif)Google has a cute logo today celebrating its turning 11 (it was founded Sept 4, 1998).  
  
It went public in 2004 so you can't see the complete picture of the success the company has had in its [stock chart](https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chdet=1254058171111&chddm=504390&chls=IntervalBasedLine&q=NASDAQ:GOOG&ntsp=0), but nonetheless, its [history is a phenomenal story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google).  
  
Compare Google's story with [this chart of the newspaper industry](https://www.mint.com/blog/trends/the-death-of-the-newspaper/) that has been making the  rounds of Twitter and blogs.  
  
Newspapers even had a head start on the Internet, but Google thrived while newspapers have seen their fortunes precipitously decline.  
  
What will the next 11 years hold?
