[![forbesschaefer.jpg](/assets_c/2009/08/forbesschaefer-thumb-485x274-493.webp)](/images/forbesschaefer.webp)Still wondering about this [Twitter thing](https://twitter.com/).  
  
[Mark Schaefer](https://www.businessesgrow.com/home), a Knoxville marketing guy who's developed an expertise in the emerging social media marketing area, has parlayed Twitter into more publicity than his marketing budget could buy - by well over 1,000 percent by my conservative reckoning.  
  
Schaefer developed a professional relationship through Twitter than led to him being interviewed as social media expert in a recent [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/31/top-twitter-tips-entrepreneurs-technology-twitter.html?feed=twitter) and being quoted in the same piece as social media expert [Chris Brogan](https://twitter.com/chrisbrogan) and Comcast's uber customer service rep [Frank Eliason](https://twitter.com/comcastcares).  
  
He tells the story in a [blog post](https://schaefersolutions.blogspot.com/2009/08/formula-for-social-media-business.html). (My own first contact with Schaefer was on Twitter.) No matter how smart or talented he is,it's unlikely he would have developed such a national profile without Twitter.  
  
Now, that can't be bad for business. Might there just be something to this social media stuff beside Facebook quizzes and "get hundreds of followers" pitches?
