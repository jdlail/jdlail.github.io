new post from me at GigaOM: "Memo to newspapers: The future of media is a two-way street" <https://t.co/RzGJPdx> tip [@mediagazer](https://twitter.com/mediagazer)[Wed Aug 17 22:17:07](https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/103953529265336320 "Wed Aug 17 22:17:07 ") via [TweetDeck](https://www.tweetdeck.com/)[![](https://a0.twimg.com/profile_images/827583004/100-0067-65by83_normal.JPG)](https://twitter.com/mathewi)**[Mathew Ingram](https://twitter.com/mathewi)**

Even if newsrooms don't want to adopt [Joy Mayer's value statements](https://rjionline.org/sites/default/files/engagement-guide_8.pdf) listed below, this should be something newsrooms are discussing. Many journalists are still very uncomfortable with the "two-way street" idea. Mayer has spent a year on a [Reynolds Journalism Institute fellowship](https://joymayer.com/about/) doing research and producing guidance on audience engagement.  
  
The value statements from her latest report:  
  
> Our core audience feels a connection with us.  
>
> We actively reach beyond our core audience.  
>
> We appear to be and actually are accessible, as a newsroom  
> and as individual journalists.  
>
> Individual community members feel invited into our processes and products  
> and encouraged to help shape our agenda.  
>
> We find ways to listen to and be in continual conversation with our community.  
>
> We continually alter what we cover, and how, based on what the audience  
> responds to.  
>
> It is easy for community members to share their expertise and experiences,  
> and we value their contributions.  
>
> We amplify community voices besides our own.  
>
> We invest in our community and are seen as a community resource.  
>
> Our content reaches the audience where, when and how it's most useful  
> or meaningful.  
>
> There are a variety of ways users can act on, share and react to our news  
> and information.
