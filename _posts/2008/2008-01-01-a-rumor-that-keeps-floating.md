[![Led Zeppelin](/images/ledzeppelin1971-thumb-150x150.webp)](/images/ledzeppelin1971.webp)The rumor about [Led Zeppelin headlining at Bonnaroo](/2007/12/stairway-to-manchester.html) just won't [go away](https://www.knoxviews.com/node/6624). Maybe that means there's [some truth to it](https://knoxvilletalks.com/2008/01/01/robert-plant-may-be-headed-to-tennessee/) or maybe it means the Internet is nothing but an echo chamber.  
  
My suspicion is that AC Entertainment's Ashley Capps is loving keeping us guessing about whether [the band](https://www.ledzeppelin.com/) will be in Manchester.
