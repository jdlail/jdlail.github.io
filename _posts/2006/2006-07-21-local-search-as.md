Howard Owens has some interesting thoughts on [local search](https://www.howardowens.com/index.cfm?action=full_text&ARTICLE_ID=2121) and self-serve advertising models. Lots of people see local search as easy money, the last Internet landscape yet to be conquered. But in truth the market is already fragmented online and off-line. And advertisers that have not already embraced Google's self-service ad tools may just be disclined to become advertising DIYers. Instead of conquer, think cultivation.
