The death of 25-year-old Brad Renfro was big news in KnoxVegas on Tuesday night and Wednesday. Two things struck me: how fast the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Renfro) was updated to reflect his death (very shortly after the story was broken TMZ.com) and how quickly videos appeared in [](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=search_videos&search_query=brad%20renfro&search_sort=video_date_uploaded&search_category=0&search=Search&v=&uploaded=&filter=1)[YouTube.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Renfro)

As the New York Times noted in July, in addition to being an encyclopedia, Wikipedia is doing breaking news, [history as it happens](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/magazine/01WIKIPEDIA-t.html?ex=1340942400&en=cc8a71cf15fcaff4&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss).

While most of the celebrity and gossip news sties were regurgitating [the same info](https://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=%22brad+renfro%22), people were creating some pretty original content on YouTube.

And if you were looking for art of Renfro, flickr [had much to offer](https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22brad%20renfro%22&w=all).

Before is one of the tribute videos posted on YouTube.
