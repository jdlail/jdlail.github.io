Now we know that 2010 was the year that the declining line of newspaper readership and the growing line of online news consumption crossed.  
  
Eric Sass in [MediaDailyNews](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=146704&nid=124709):  
  
> The inevitable shift finally came in 2010, as more Americans got their daily news from online sources other than print, according to the Biannual News Consumption Survey from the [Pew Research Center](https://pewresearch.org/ "Pew Research Center") for the People & the Press. The findings were released this week as part of Pew's annual overview of the news media.  
>
> Specifically, Pew found that the proportion of U.S. adults who said they got their news online the day before increased from 29% in 2008 to 34% in 2010. The proportion that cited print newspapers as the source of their recent news fell from 34% in 2008 to 31% in 2010.
