Join us Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Knoxville News Sentinel, 2332 News Sentinel Drive. You must [register in advance](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffKMglrA51QiMiRSE8OPORXQvc-951DLk7HIveSFytL5wyCw/viewform).

The workshop will cover tools journalists can use to help create and share incredible stories as well as offer advice on how to engage the public in stories about their community.
