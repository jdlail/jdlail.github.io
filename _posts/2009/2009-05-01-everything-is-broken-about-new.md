[Seth Godin](https://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/04/this-is-broken.html) says his 2006 talk, "Everything is Broken," still rings true for the most part. I think most of us would agree if business is getting smarter, they're not sharing.  
  
Which let me to muse about what's still "broken" (or maybe the most critically broken things) about newspapers?  
  
[Mark Cuban](https://blogmaverick.com/2009/04/26/1269/) says one is the way we handle our account relationships with subscribers. "You need to get reader's credit cards on files and start being the baby Amazon of your local area." I think his point would have fit easily into Godin's video in 2006 or 2009 or in 1986.

What do you think is still broken about newspapers?
