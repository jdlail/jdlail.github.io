I'm testing my ability to post to my blog with this tiny Nokia n800 Internet tablet and a Bluetooth keyboard. It actually does seem to work! Although it took a little trial and error. Steve Yelvington inspired me to try to see if this could be used for remote posting. I haven't gotten use to the keyboard, but other than that, it's pretty sweet. Sort of a poor man's iPhone. Course it's not a phone, but rather an Internet tablet ( [www.nseries.com/products/n800](https://www.nseries.com/products/n800) } Worth taking a look at if you just need to surf and not a phone.
