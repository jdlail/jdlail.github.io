![Media Innovation Awards](/images/mediainnovationawards.webp)[Knoxnews](https://www.knoxnews.com/) won three Digital Edge Awards on Monday from the Newspaper Association of America. The Digital Edge Awards are part of the NAA's larger Media Innovation Awards. Winning was good!  
  
The Digital Edge Awards, or Edgies, are one of the most prestigious online newspapers awards. The Knoxville News Sentinel competes in a category with a large number of papers, those with print circulations between 75,000 and 250,000. There are many excellent newspaper Web sites in this group and lots of innovative things happening.  
  
We won:  
  
Best Overall News Site  
  
Most Innovative Visitor Participation ([schoolmatters.knoxnews.com](https://schoolmatters.knoxnews.com/))  
  
Best Design and Site Architecture.  
  
Here is a [complete list](https://www.naa.org/blog/digitaledge/1/2008/02/NAA-Announces-Digital-Edge-Award-Winners.cfm) and [details](https://www.naa.org/docs/Digital-Edge/MedIAs_de2008awards.pdf).  
  
There are a number of talented people working on knoxnews/govolsxtra at both the newspaper and the corporate level in Knoxville. A hat tip to all! But I'd especially like to thank the newsroom team of  Deputy Managing Editor Tom Chester, Online Editor Jigsha Desai and online producers Lauren Spuhler, Erin Chapin and Talid Magdy.  
  
We also have this semester two talented practicum students from the University of Tennessee: Yolanda Ortiz and Samantha Thornton.  
  
(Katie Kolt Hall was also an online producer during the time covered by this contest. She's, now doing wonderful things as the Web content specialist at the [Knoxville Area Chamber Partnership](https://www.knoxvillechamber.com/).)  
  
They rock the house!
