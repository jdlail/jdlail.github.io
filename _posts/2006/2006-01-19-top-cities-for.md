I thought [this](https://www.hotwire.com/pop-up/tvi-ratings-detail-popup.jsp?lid=destination-tvi.jsp:destination-tvi:loc:0:ratingsDetail) was interesting. Knoxville is in the Top 10 as a "value travel" destination, according to a Hotwire index.  Well, it's even in the Top 5. 1\. Denver, CO 2\. Greenville-Spartanburg, SC 3\. Raleigh-Durham, NC 4\. Knoxville, TN 5\. Tampa-St Petersburg-Sarasota, FL 6\. Albuquerque-Santa Fe, NM 7\. Orlando-Daytona Beach, FL 8\. Reno, NV 9\. Dallas-Fort Worth, TX 10\. Los Angeles, CA The Hotwire Travel Value Index ranks the 50 most-visited cities in the US for visitor value. Each city is scored in three categories (on a 100-point scale): Low rates on air, rental car and hotel Discounts on air, rental car and hotel Affordable entertainment and overall appeal Course, there's no point in visiting a city if you live there, right? Some of the other nine in the Top 10 looked like fun places to go.
