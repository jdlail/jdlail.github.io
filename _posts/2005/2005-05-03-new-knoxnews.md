We launched a redesigned [knoxnews.com](https://www.knoxnews.com/) last Thursday. Long days, little sleep, lots of coffee = looks great. The designers and programmers that made it happen on the corporate side did a great job.

It's a radical departure from what we had and, to some, it's moved away from what they think a newspaper site should look like. See for yourself. An update: Noticed a [nice note](https://smallinitiatives.com/2005/04/29/a-redesign-scripps-style/) on Jay Small's site with some insightful comments.
