![Data on tape](/images/tapelib.webp)I'm speaking to a journalism class at the University of Tennessee this morning about:  
  
* Computer-Assisted Reporting
* Computational Journalism
* Open Government Data Advocacy efforts

I thought I might pass along the link set I created around what I plan to talk about. This is designed as a sampler, not an exhaustive list, but I would appreciate any feedback you might have on it.
