**_UPDATE: The Pigeon Forge Supercharger is up and running. It's at a shopping center on Teaster Lane near Wears Valley Road. It has 12 stalls (up to 250 kW)._**

_**It doesn't show up as operational on the Tesla web map on Tuesday, June 29, 2021, but reports in the Tennessee and Western North Carolina Tesla Facebook groups say it just opened so it should start showing up on the web map, on the app and on the in-car display.**_

_**It is near a REI store in the[shopping complex](https://goo.gl/maps/XUxY6UUQFu9jpcVh9).**_

**_This will be a big plus for those going to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Sevierville-Pigeon Forge-Gatlinburg area. It should alleviate some of the traffic at the[Knoxville Supercharger at Turkey Creek](https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&bounds=35.913015762723646%2C-84.12603056066894%2C35.88962050841526%2C-84.17323743933105&zoom=15&filters=store%2Cservice%2Csupercharger%2Cdestination%20charger%2Cbodyshop&search=10936%20Parkside%20Dr%2C%20Knoxville%2C%20TN%2037934%2C%20USA&location=knoxvillesupercharger)_**,**_(up to 150 kW)._**

Tesla has put a supercharger on its map for Pigeon Forge in the third quarter of 2021 with the timing and locstion subject to change.

This is good news for Tesla owners because the area around the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a dead zone with the nearest supercharger in West Knoxville.

A couple restaurants and attractions do have destination chargers, but not enough to handle the visitors.
