Louis Gray says all salaried folks are [working for free](https://www.louisgray.com/live/2008/02/february-29ths-leap-day-robs-us-all.html) today because of Leap Day. There are 366 days in the year this year and only 365 last year and next year.  
  
But wait, my annual bonus fell into my bank account today.  
  
Nevermind. It truly is a bonus day. Even the accountants have a sense of humor.
