[Ethan Kaplan](https://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2008/01/24/time-machine-part-3/) and [Chris Brogan](https://chrisbrogan.com/advice-for-traditional-and-local-news-media/) have done some blog posts on thoughts on newspapers and traditional media. Kaplan pulls some thoughts he had years ago and Brogan's were cultivated from a recent panel discussion.  
  
It is interesting Kaplan's thoughts from seven years ago and a decade ago are similar to Brogan's today.  
  
Kind of tells you just how far mainstream media has moved, doesn't it?
