[![Preview presents: Greetings from Knoxville - Songs by local musicians](/images/0426preview_cover_w500%5B1%5D-thumb.webp)](/images/0426preview_cover_w500%5B1%5D.webp) Wayne Bledsoe, co-worker and News Sentinel music writer, has been spearheading an effort to do a CD of Knoxville music sponsored by the paper. He's hassled through record companies, production details and a cover art battle to get what is hoped to be a annual series of local music CDs. The CD, called "Preview presents: Greetings from Knoxville - Songs by local musicians," is coming out now. Luckily, the CD is longer than the title -- much longer. Sez Wayne:

> People can get a little sick of hearing me talk about how great the music scene is in Knoxville. It hasn't exactly reached the point of chest-bumping and beer spilling, but when I get a phone caller expounding on the greatness of the music in his or her own city, I usually end the conversation feeling sorry for the deluded caller, thinking, "Friend, you have no idea."
