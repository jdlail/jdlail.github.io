[![Fireworks at Badin Lake](/images/dsc_0014_fireworks-thumb.webp)](/images/dsc_0014_fireworks.webp)

We watched a fireworks show at Badin Lake on Wednesday night. We had a great spot to see them and I'll post some more photos in a bit. We were on the shore, but there were loads of boats on the water. _Updated: Some more[photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdlail/sets/72157600669499579/) of the fireworks._ Tags: [fireworks](https://technorati.com/tag/firesworks) | [Badin Lake](https://technorati.com/tag/Badin Lake)
