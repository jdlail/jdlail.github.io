Is MSNBC's [Dylan Ratigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Ratigan) Occupy Wall Street's [Rick Santelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Santelli)?  
  
The above video with TV business/financial journalist Dylan Ratigan going on a "[mad as hell](https://www.dylanratigan.com/2011/08/10/im-mad-as-hell-how-about-you/)" rant has been among YouTube's trending videos over the last few days.  
  
In this video, Ratigan's message is associated with the Occupy Wall Street protests, but [the rant was actually made](https://www.inquisitr.com/133805/ratigan-rant-goes-viral-as-dylan-ratigan-melts-down-on-air-video/) on August 9 before the protests began in New York.  
  
A version of the video went [viral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral) then as well. Ratigan [explains his rant in more detail on his blog](https://www.dylanratigan.com/2011/08/10/im-mad-as-hell-how-about-you/).  
  
It's strangely reminiscent of Rick Santelli's Feb 19, 2009 [rant on CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or-EKjfVCoA&feature=player_embedded#%21) that called for a Chicago Tea Party that helped [give voice to that movement](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/rick-santelli-tea-party-time/).  
  
Like Santelli, Ratigan seems to articulate the rage and frustration of the grassroots picking up on their message (those who identity themselves as in the [Tea Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29PhHdLsyFE) in Santelli's case and those in the [Occupy Wall Street](https://occupywallst.org/) movement in Ratigan's).  
  
In both cases, it is an odd role for journalist as observer.
