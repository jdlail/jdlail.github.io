In a post titled "Great moments in journalism: Headlines have midair collision on newspaper website," Silicon Valley's Valleywag pointed to an "[unfortunate collisions of stories](https://valleywag.com/tech/great-moments-in-journalism/headlines-have-midair-collision-on-newspaper-website-302041.php)" on the [The Chattanoogan.com](https://www.chattanoogan.com/), the Web-only newspaper Chattanooga.
