Twitter weather reports from Nashville. I think we'd better get ready for a stormy night in Knoxville.  
  
[nitweet](https://twitter.com/nitweet)   confirmed tornado in lawrence county - buffalo road.  
  
[Busymom](https://twitter.com/busymom)   Heh, "hen egg" sized hail being reported  
  
[scottmerrick](https://twitter.com/scottmerrick)   just saw an instantaneous lightning/thunder occurance a half block away on the roof of a building. Cool!    
  
[r](https://twitter.com/r)   It sure is a dark and stormy night here in Nashville -- except it's noon  
  
[Busymom](https://twitter.com/Busymom)   @moogiesworld Big storm (tornado?) bearing down on my neighborhood in a few minutes
